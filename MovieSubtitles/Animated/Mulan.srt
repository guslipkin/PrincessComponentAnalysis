1
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,473
We're under attack! Light the signal !

2
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:05,416
Light the fire now! Light the signal !

3
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,336
Now all of China knows you're here.

4
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,385
Perfect.

5
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,355
Your Majesty, the Huns have
crossed our northern border.

6
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,150
Impossible.
No one can get through the Great Wall.

7
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,319
Shan-Yu is leading them.

8
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,949
We'll set up defenses
around your palace immediately.

9
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:42,870
No. Send your troops
to protect my people. Chi Fu.

10
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,038
Yes, Your Highness?

11
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,667
Deliver conscription notices
throughout all the provinces.

12
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:51,087
Call up reserves
and as many new recruits as possible.

13
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,299
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
but I believe my troops can stop him.

14
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,802
I won't take any chances, General.

15
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,638
A single grain of rice can tip the scale.

16
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:04,767
One man may be the difference
between victory and defeat.

17
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,730
"Quiet and demure.

18
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,733
"Graceful. Polite.

19
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,735
"Delicate.

20
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,780
"Refined. Poised.

21
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,284
"Punctual."

22
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,290
Little brother!

23
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,501
Little brother.

24
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,838
There you are.

25
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,341
Who's the smartest doggy in the world?
Come on, smart boy.

26
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,678
Can you help me with my chores today?

27
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,587
Honorable ancestors,

28
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:19,926
please help Mulan impress
the Matchmaker today.

29
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,558
Please.

30
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:30,686
Please help her.

31
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,402
Father, I brought your. . .

32
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,279
-Mulan.
-I brought a spare.

33
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,405
Mulan.

34
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,407
Remember, the doctor said
three cups of tea in the morning. . .

35
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,284
-Mulan.
-And three at night.

36
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:49,580
Mulan, you should already be in town.
We are counting on you. . .

37
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,375
To uphold the family honor.

38
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,795
Don't worry, Father.
I won't let you down.

39
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,631
-Wish me luck.
-Hurry!

40
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,804
I'm going to pray some more.

41
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,477
Fa Li, is your daughter here yet?

42
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,814
The Matchmaker
is not a patient woman.

43
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:19,777
Of all days to be late. . . I should have
prayed to the ancestors for luck.

44
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,030
How lucky can they be? They're dead.

45
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,951
Besides, I've got all the luck we'll need.

46
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,829
This is your chance to prove yourself.

47
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,918
Grandma, no!

48
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,683
Yep, this cricket's a lucky one!

49
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,568
I'm here.

50
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,195
What? But, Mama, I had to. . .

51
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,782
None of your excuses.
Now, let's get you cleaned up.

52
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,621
This is what you give me to work with

53
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,250
Well, honey, l've seen worse

54
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,961
We're gonna turn this sow's ear

55
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,796
lnto a silk purse

56
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,590
It's freezing.

57
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,135
It would have been warm
if you were here on time.

58
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,013
We'll have you washed and dried

59
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,807
Primped and polished
till you glow with pride

60
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,685
Trust my recipe for instant bride

61
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,396
You'll bring honor to us all

62
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,399
-Mulan, what's this?
-Notes,

63
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,485
in case I forget something.

64
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,654
Hold this.
We'll need more luck than I thought.

65
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,908
Wait and see when we're through

66
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,619
Boys will gladly go to war for you

67
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,747
-With good fortune
-And a great hairdo

68
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,000
You'll bring honor to us all

69
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,087
A girl can bring her family

70
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,173
Great honor in one way

71
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,176
By striking a good match

72
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,678
And this could be the day

73
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,015
Men want girls with good taste

74
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,350
-CaIm
-Obedient

75
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,851
Who work fast-paced

76
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,896
-With good breeding
-And a tiny waist

77
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,316
You'll bring honor to us all

78
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,278
We all must serve our Emperor

79
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,948
Who guards us from the Huns

80
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,534
The men by bearing arms

81
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,078
A girl by bearing sons

82
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,373
When we're through you can't fail

83
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,292
Like a lotus blossom soft and pale

84
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,170
How could any fellow say, "No sale"

85
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:50,386
You'll bring honor to us all

86
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,513
There. You're ready.

87
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:56,350
Not yet. An apple for serenity.

88
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,103
A pendant for balance.

89
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,438
Beads ofjade

90
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,441
For beauty

91
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,403
You must proudly

92
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,822
Show it

93
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,616
Now add a cricket

94
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,035
Just for Iuck

95
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,247
And even you can't blow it

96
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,709
Ancestors, hear my plea

97
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,545
Help me not to make a fool of me

98
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,381
And to not uproot my family tree

99
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:31,844
Keep my father standing tall

100
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,680
Scarier than the undertaker

101
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,766
We are meeting our matchmaker

102
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,269
Destiny, guard our girls

103
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,272
And our future as it fast unfurIs

104
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,275
Please look kindly
on these cultured pearls

105
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,196
Each a perfect porcelain doll

106
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:56,160
-Please bring honor to us
-Please bring honor to us

107
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:02,082
Please bring honor to us all

108
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,048
"Fa Mulan."

109
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,426
-Present.
-Speaking without permission.

110
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,722
Who spit in her bean curd?

111
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,648
Too skinny.

112
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:31,111
Not good for bearing sons.

113
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,329
Recite the final admonition.

114
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,416
Well?

115
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,714
Fulfill your duties
calmly and respectfully.

116
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,510
Reflect before you snack. . .

117
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:59,014
Act! This shall bring you
honor and glory.

118
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,103
This way.

119
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:12,528
Now, pour the tea.

120
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,031
To please your future in-laws,

121
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,994
you must demonstrate
a sense of dignity

122
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,997
and refinement.

123
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,541
You must also be poised.

124
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,714
-Pardon me.
-And silent!

125
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,470
Could I just take that back?

126
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,972
One moment.

127
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,643
Why, you clumsy. . .

128
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,160
I think it's going well, don't you?

129
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:05,331
Put it out! Put it out! Put it out!

130
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,384
You are a disgrace!

131
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,678
You may look like a bride,

132
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:24,433
but you will never
bring your family honor!

133
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,259
Look at me

134
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,637
l will never pass

135
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,223
For a perfect bride

136
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,267
Or a perfect daughter

137
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,686
Can it be

138
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,942
l'm not meant to play this part?

139
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,736
Now I see

140
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:22,449
That if l were truly to be myself

141
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:27,496
l would break my family's heart

142
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,505
Who is that girl l see

143
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,924
Staring straight

144
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,260
Back at me?

145
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:45,097
Why is my reflection

146
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:51,437
Someone I don't know?

147
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:57,693
Somehow I cannot hide

148
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,778
Who I am

149
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,573
Though l've tried

150
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:07,661
When will my reflection show

151
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:14,543
Who I am inside?

152
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:21,967
When will my reflection show

153
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,179
Who I am

154
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,265
Inside?

155
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,827
My, my.

156
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:53,832
What beautiful blossoms
we have this year.

157
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:57,961
But, look, this one's late.

158
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,589
But I'll bet that when it blooms,

159
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:06,011
it will be the most beautiful of all.

160
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,435
What is it?

161
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,032
Mulan.

162
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,284
Stay inside.

163
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,042
Citizens, I bring a proclamation

164
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,253
from the Imperial City.

165
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,338
The Huns have invaded China.

166
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,800
By order of the Emperor,

167
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:49,429
one man from every family
must serve in the Imperial Army.

168
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,307
The Hsiao family.

169
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,769
The Yi family.

170
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,438
I will serve the Emperor
in my father's place.

171
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:02,234
-The Fa family.
-No!

172
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,585
I am ready to serve the Emperor.

173
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,754
-Father, you can't go.
-Mulan !

174
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,007
Please, sir, my father has already
fought bravely. . .

175
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,216
Silence!

176
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,468
You would do well
to teach your daughter

177
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:32,097
to hold her tongue in a man's presence.

178
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,100
Mulan, you dishonor me.

179
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,647
Report tomorrow
to the Wu Zhong camp.

180
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,941
Yes, sir.

181
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,612
The Chu family!

182
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,282
The Wen family!

183
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,453
The Chang family!

184
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,852
-You shouldn't have to go!
-Mulan. . .

185
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,188
There are plenty of young men
to fight for China.

186
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,359
It is an honor to protect my country
and my family.

187
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,361
So, you'll die for honor.

188
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,863
I will die doing what's right.

189
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,782
-But if you. . .
-I know my place!

190
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,284
It is time you learned yours.

191
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,052
Mulan is gone!

192
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,846
What?

193
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,642
It can't be.

194
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,193
Mulan !

195
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,074
No.

196
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,537
You must go after her.
She could be killed.

197
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,373
If I reveal her,

198
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,876
she will be.

199
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:23,471
Ancestors, hear our prayer.

200
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,639
Watch over Mulan.

201
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,830
Mushu, awaken.

202
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,339
I live!

203
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,718
So tell me what mortal needs
my protection, great ancestor.

204
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,262
-You just say the word and I'm there.
-Mushu. . .

205
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,639
And let me say somethin'.

206
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,099
Anybody who's foolish enough
to threaten our family,

207
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,726
vengeance will be mine!

208
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,772
Mushu !

209
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,608
These are the family guardians.

210
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,195
-They. . .
-Protect the family.

211
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,949
And you, O demoted one?

212
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,826
I ring the gong.

213
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:31,289
That's right.
Now, wake up the ancestors.

214
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:35,126
One family reunion comin' right up.

215
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:37,629
Okay, people, people, look alive.
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

216
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,255
Let's move it. Rise and shine.

217
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,467
Y'all way past the beauty sleep thing,
trust me.

218
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:51,267
I knew it. I knew it. That Mulan was
a troublemaker from the start!

219
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,895
Don't look at me.
She gets it from your side of the family.

220
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,439
She's just trying to help her father.

221
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,192
But if she's discovered,
Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.

222
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,487
Dishonor will come to the family.
Traditional values will disintegrate.

223
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,322
Not to mention, they'll lose the farm.

224
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:08,243
My children never caused such trouble.
They all became acupuncturists.

225
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,287
-We can't all be acupuncturists.
-No!

226
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,582
Your great-granddaughter
had to be a cross-dresser!

227
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,087
Let a guardian bring her back.

228
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,131
Yes, awaken the most cunning.

229
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,133
No. The swiftest.

230
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,844
-No. Send the wisest.
-Silence!

231
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,930
We must send the most powerful of all.

232
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:34,227
Okay, okay, I get the drift. I'll go.

233
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,692
Y'all don't think I can do it.
Watch this here.

234
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,944
Jump back. I'm pretty hot, huh?

235
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,238
Don't make me have to singe nobody
to prove no point.

236
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,033
You had your chance
to protect the Fa family.

237
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,785
Your misguidance led
Fa Deng to disaster.

238
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,080
-Yeah, thanks a lot.
-And your point is?

239
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:59,502
The point is we will be sending
a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.

240
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,838
What. . . What. . . I'm a real dragon !

241
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:07,635
You are not worthy of this spot.
Now, awaken the Great Stone Dragon.

242
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,098
So you'll get back to me
on the job thing?

243
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,145
Just one chance,
is that too much to ask?

244
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,398
I mean, it's not like it'd kill ya.

245
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,860
Yo, Rocky, wake up!
Ya gotta go fetch Mulan !

246
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,116
Come on, boy! Go get her! Go on !

247
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,410
Come on.

248
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,420
Hello?

249
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:46,925
Hello!

250
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,228
Stony?

251
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,439
Stony? Man, they're gonna kill me.

252
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,942
Great Stone Dragon,

253
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,778
have you awakened?

254
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,365
Yes, I just woke up.

255
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:14,202
I'm. . . I'm the Great Stone Dragon.
Good morning.

256
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,830
I will go forth and fetch Mulan.

257
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,208
Did I mention that
I was the Great Stone Dragon?

258
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:23,294
Go! The fate of the Fa family

259
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,964
rests in your claws.

260
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:29,551
Don't even worry about it.
I will not lose face.

261
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,681
My elbow!

262
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,559
I know I twisted somethin'.

263
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,688
That's just great. Now what?

264
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,772
I'm doomed,

265
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:46,568
and all 'cause Miss Man decides
to take her little drag show on the road.

266
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,366
Go get her?
What's the matter with you?

267
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,326
After this Great Stone,
Humpty Dumpty mess,

268
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,496
I'd have to bring her home
with a medal to get back in the temple.

269
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,832
Wait a minute. That's it!

270
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,085
I make Mulan a war hero, and they'll be
begging me to come back to work.

271
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,046
That's the master plan.
You done it now, man.

272
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,427
What makes you think you're comin'?

273
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,680
You're lucky?

274
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,683
Do I look like a sucker to you?

275
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,185
What you mean, a loser?

276
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,979
How 'bout I pop one of your
antennas off, throw it across the yard?

277
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,064
Then who's the loser, me or you?

278
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:00,683
Imperial scouts.

279
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,195
Shan-Yu.

280
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,828
Nice work, gentlemen.
You found the Hun army.

281
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,416
The Emperor will stop you.

282
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,003
Stop me? He invited me.

283
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,550
By building his wall,
he challenged my strength.

284
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,886
I'm here to play his game.

285
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:43,893
Go! Tell your Emperor
to send his strongest armies.

286
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,228
I'm ready.

287
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,776
How many men does it take
to deliver a message?

288
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,487
One.

289
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,702
Okay, okay, how about this?

290
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,162
Excuse me.

291
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,290
Where do I sign in?

292
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:09,544
I see you have a sword. I have one, too.

293
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,046
They're very manly and tough.

294
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,885
I'm working on it!

295
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,014
Who am I fooling?

296
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:24,225
It's going to take a miracle
to get me into the army.

297
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,228
Did I hear someone ask for a miracle?

298
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,814
Let me hear you say "Aaah"!

299
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,025
-That's close enough.
-A ghost.

300
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:35,570
Get ready, Mulan.
Your serpentine salvation is at hand !

301
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,656
For I have been sent by your ancestors

302
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,409
to guide you through your masquerade.

303
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,578
Come on. If you're gonna stay,
you're gonna work.

304
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:48,124
So heed my word ! 'Cause if
the army finds out you're a girl,

305
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,419
the penalty is death !

306
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,548
-Who are you?
-Who am I? Who am I?

307
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:59,052
I am the guardian of lost souls.

308
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,763
I am the powerful, the pleasurable,

309
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,307
the indestructible Mushu.

310
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,352
Pretty hot, huh?

311
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,945
My ancestors sent
a little lizard to help me?

312
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,782
Dragon, dragon, not lizard.

313
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,493
I don't do that tongue thing.

314
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,495
You're. . .

315
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,830
Intimidating? Awe-inspiring?

316
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,374
-Tiny.
-Of course.

317
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,209
I'm travel size for your convenience.

318
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,088
If I was my real size,
your cow here would die of fright.

319
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:39,550
Down, Bessie. My powers are
beyond your mortal imagination.

320
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:43,971
For instance, my eyes can see
straight through your armor.

321
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:49,060
All right, that's it! Dishonor!
Dishonor on your whole family.

322
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,897
Make a note of this. Dishonor on you,
dishonor on your cow. . .

323
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,067
Stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

324
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,569
I'm just nervous.
I've never done this before.

325
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:02,407
Then you're gonna have to trust me.
And don't you slap me no more.

326
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,617
We clear on that? All right.

327
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,577
Okey-dokey.
Let's get this show on the road !

328
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:07,745
Cri-Kee, get the bags.

329
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,248
Let's move it, Heifer.

330
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,712
Okay, this is it.
Time to show 'em your man walk.

331
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:21,092
Shoulders back, chest high,
feet apart, head up and strut.

332
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:25,680
Two, three. . . Break it down.
Hup, two, three. And work it!

333
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,060
-Beautiful, isn't he?
-They're disgusting.

334
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,478
No, they're men.

335
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:34,730
Now, you gonna have to act
just like them, so pay attention.

336
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:39,193
Look. This tattoo will protect me
from harm.

337
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,408
I hope you can get your money back.

338
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,493
I don't think I can do this.

339
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:50,288
It's all attitude.
Be tough, like this guy here.

340
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,541
What are you lookin' at?

341
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,252
Punch him. It's how men say hello.

342
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,339
Yao, you've made a friend.

343
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,884
Good. Now slap him on the behind.
They like that.

344
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,015
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

345
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:13,853
Yao, relax and chant with me.

346
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,654
Feel better?

347
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,492
Yeah. You ain't worth my time.

348
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,660
-Chicken boy.
-Chicken boy?

349
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:32,038
Say that to my face, ya limp noodle!

350
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,544
Sorry, Ling.

351
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,549
You're dead !

352
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,055
There he goes!

353
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,867
Guys.

354
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:13,204
The Huns have struck here,
here and here.

355
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,207
I will take the main troops
up to the Tung Shao Pass,

356
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,961
and stop Shan-Yu
before he destroys this village.

357
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,380
Excellent strategy, sir.

358
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,341
I do love surprises.

359
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,928
You will stay and train the new recruits.

360
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,764
When Chi Fu believes you're ready,

361
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,849
you will join us, Captain.

362
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,851
Captain?

363
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:40,022
This is an enormous
responsibility, General.

364
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,024
Perhaps a soldier
with more experience.

365
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:46,487
Number one in his class, extensive
knowledge of training techniques,

366
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:49,115
and impressive military lineage.

367
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,951
I believe Li Shang will do
an excellent job.

368
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:56,414
I will. I won't let you down.
This is. . . I mean. . .

369
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,417
-Yes, sir.
-Very good, then.

370
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,004
We'll toast China's victory
at the Imperial City.

371
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:06,299
I'll expect a full report in three weeks.

372
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:09,677
And I won't leave anything out.

373
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,432
Captain Li Shang.

374
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,395
Leader of China's finest troops.

375
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,857
No. The greatest troops of all time.

376
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,201
Most impressive.

377
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,999
Good luck, Captain !

378
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,384
Good luck, Father.

379
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,311
Day one.

380
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,898
Soldiers!

381
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,817
He started it!

382
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,327
I don't need anyone
causing trouble in my camp.

383
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,329
Sorry.

384
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,249
I mean, sorry you had to see that.

385
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,586
But you know how it is
when you get those manly urges

386
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,338
and you just gotta kill somethin',

387
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:31,008
fix things, cook outdoors. . .

388
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:34,762
What's your name?

389
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,516
Your commanding officer
just asked you a question.

390
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,895
I've got a name.
And it's a boy's name, too.

391
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,773
-Ling. How 'bout Ling?
-His name is Ling.

392
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,859
I didn't ask for his name.
I asked for yours!

393
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,696
-Try, Chu.
-Chu.

394
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,282
-Chu?
-Gesundheit. I kill myself.

395
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,867
-Mushu.
-Mushu?

396
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,536
-No.
-Then what is it?

397
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,497
-Ping was my best friend growin' up.
-It's Ping.

398
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,917
-Ping?
-Of course, Ping did steal my. . .

399
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,294
Yes, my name is Ping.

400
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,005
Let me see your conscription notice.

401
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:15,386
-Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?
-I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.

402
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,556
He doesn't talk about me much.

403
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:27,982
I can see why.
That boy's an absolute lunatic.

404
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,612
Okay, gentlemen,
thanks to your new friend, Ping,

405
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:37,491
you'll spend tonight
picking up every single grain of rice.

406
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:41,412
And tomorrow, the real work begins.

407
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,752
You know, we have to work
on your people skills.

408
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,025
All right! Rise and shine,
Sleeping Beauty.

409
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,360
Come on. Hup, hup, hup.

410
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,364
Get your clothes on.

411
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,366
Get ready. Got breakfast for ya.

412
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:24,163
Look, you get porridge,
and it's happy to see you.

413
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,874
Get outta there!
You gonna make people sick.

414
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,584
-Am I late?
-No time to talk.

415
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,294
Now remember,
it's your first day of training,

416
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,963
so listen to your teacher and no fightin',
play nice with the other kids,

417
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,340
unless one of the other kids
wanna fight,

418
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,342
then you have to kick
the other kid's butt.

419
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,968
But I don't wanna kick
the other kid's butt.

420
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,637
Don't talk with your mouth full.

421
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,473
Now let's see your war face.

422
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,850
I think my bunny slippers
just ran for cover.

423
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,435
Come on ! Scare me, girl.

424
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,647
Yeah, that's my tough-lookin' warrior.

425
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:53,234
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Now, get out there and make me proud.

426
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,530
-What do you mean the troops just left?
-They what?

427
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:03,577
Wait! You forgot your sword.

428
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:08,415
My little baby, off to destroy people.

429
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,548
Order. People, order.

430
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,551
-I'd like a pan-fried noodle.
-Sweet and pungent shrimp.

431
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,262
-Moo goo gai pan.
-That's not funny.

432
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,725
Looks like our new friend
slept in this morning.

433
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,354
Hello, Ping. Are ya hungry?

434
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:34,066
Yeah, 'cause I owe you
a knuckle sandwich.

435
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,360
Soldiers!

436
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,118
You will assemble swiftly
and silently every morning.

437
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,913
Anyone who acts otherwise

438
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,165
will answer to me.

439
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,043
Tough guy.

440
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,254
Yao.

441
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:03,429
Thank you for volunteering.
Retrieve the arrow.

442
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,600
I'll get that arrow, pretty boy,

443
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:11,020
and I'll do it with my shirt on.

444
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,774
One moment.
You seem to be missing something.

445
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,739
This represents discipline,

446
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,702
and this represents strength.

447
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,081
You need both to reach the arrow.

448
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,106
We've got a long way to go.

449
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:08,285
Let's get down to business

450
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,997
To defeat the Huns

451
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:16,710
Did they send me daughters

452
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:20,965
When I asked for sons?

453
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,635
You're the saddest bunch I ever met

454
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:29,181
But you can bet before we're through

455
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:33,227
Mister, l'll make a man

456
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,063
Out of you

457
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,819
Tranquil as a forest

458
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:46,490
But on fire within

459
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:50,995
Once you find your center

460
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,915
You are sure to win

461
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,961
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot

462
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,673
And you haven't got a clue

463
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:07,761
Somehow I'II make a man

464
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,347
Out of you

465
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,435
l'm never gonna catch my breath

466
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,437
Say goodbye to those who knew me

467
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:20,649
Boy, was l a fool
in school for cutting gym

468
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,860
This guy's got 'em scared to death

469
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,862
Hope he doesn't see right through me

470
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:28,032
Now l really wish
that I knew how to swim

471
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:33,370
-Be a man
-We must be swift as a coursing river

472
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:36,915
-Be a man
-With all the force of a great typhoon

473
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,004
-Be a man
-With all the strength of a raging fire

474
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:48,594
Mysterious as the dark side
of the moon

475
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,724
Time is racing toward us

476
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:58,562
TiII the Huns arrive

477
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:02,649
Heed my every order

478
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:06,570
And you might survive

479
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,991
You're unsuited for the rage of war

480
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:14,953
So pack up, go home, you're through

481
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:18,832
How couId I make a man

482
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:23,462
Out of you?

483
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,299
-Be a man
-We must be swift as a coursing river

484
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:31,845
-Be a man
-With all the force of a great typhoon

485
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,350
-Be a man
-With all the strength of a raging fire

486
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,603
Mysterious as the dark side

487
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,607
Of the moon

488
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:48,654
-Be a man
-We must be swift as a coursing river

489
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:53,200
-Be a man
-With all the force of a great typhoon

490
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:57,621
-Be a man
-With all the strength of a raging fire

491
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,791
Mysterious as the dark side

492
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,794
Of the moon

493
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,739
What do you see?

494
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:36,451
Black pine, from the high mountains.

495
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,372
White horse hair. Imperial stallions.

496
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,584
Sulfur, from cannons.

497
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:47,504
This doll came from a village
in the Tung Shao Pass,

498
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,840
where the Imperial Army
is waiting for us.

499
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,176
We can avoid them easily.

500
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,678
No.

501
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:59,016
The quickest way
to the Emperor is through that pass.

502
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,979
And besides,
the little girl will be missing her doll.

503
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,148
We should return it to her.

504
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,617
No, this is not a good idea.
What if somebody sees you?

505
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,745
Just because I look like a man
doesn't mean I have to smell like one.

506
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:24,208
So a couple of guys don't rinse out their
socks. Picky, picky, picky.

507
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,044
Myself, I kind of like that
corn chip smell.

508
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,632
Okay, all right. That's enough.

509
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,550
Get out before you get
all pruny and stuff.

510
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,887
Mushu, if you're so worried,
go stand watch.

511
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,473
Yeah, yeah. "Stand watch, Mushu,

512
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,392
"while I blow our secret
with my stupid girlie habits."

513
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:45,103
Hygiene!

514
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:48,357
Me first! Me first!

515
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:49,733
We're doomed !

516
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,903
There are a couple of things
I know they're bound to notice!

517
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,463
Ping !

518
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,676
Hi, guys. I didn't know you were here.

519
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,263
I was just washing. So now I'm clean,
and I'm gonna go. Bye-bye.

520
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:23,392
Come back here.
I know we were jerks to you before,

521
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,894
so let's start over.

522
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:29,106
Hi. I'm Ling.

523
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,651
-And I'm Chien-Po.
-Hello, Chien-Po.

524
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,612
And I am Yao!

525
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,948
King of the rock!

526
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,451
And there's nothin'
you girls can do about it.

527
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:45,122
Yeah? I think Ping and I can take you.

528
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,832
I really don't wanna take him anywhere.

529
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,583
Ping, we have to fight!

530
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:54,131
No, we don't. We could just
close our eyes and swim around.

531
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,133
Come on. Don't be such a. . .

532
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,135
Ouch ! Something bit me!

533
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,804
What a nasty flavor.

534
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,057
Snake!

535
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,603
Oh, snake! Snake!

536
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:10,105
Snake! Snake!

537
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,486
Some king of the rock.

538
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,655
Boy, that was close.

539
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,283
No. That was vile.

540
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,827
You owe me big.

541
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,914
I never want to see a naked man again.

542
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,714
Don't look at me.
I ain't bitin' no more butts.

543
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,926
You think your troops
are ready to fight?

544
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,388
They would not last
a minute against the Huns!

545
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:46,683
-They completed their training.
-Those boys

546
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:50,562
are no more fit to be soldiers
than you are to be Captain.

547
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,273
Once the General reads my report,

548
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:56,026
your troops will never see battle.

549
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,696
No, you don't! I've worked too hard
to get Mulan into this war.

550
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,615
This guy's messin' with my plan.

551
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,784
We're not finished !

552
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,787
Be careful, Captain.
The general may be your father,

553
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,082
but I am the Emperor's counsel.

554
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:15,045
And by the way,
I got that job on my own.

555
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,839
You're dismissed.

556
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:22,511
I'll hold him and you punch.

557
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,264
Or not.

558
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:30,811
For what it's worth,
I think you're a great captain.

559
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:38,402
-I saw that.
-What?

560
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,862
You like him, don't you?

561
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,406
No!

562
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,242
Yeah, all right. Yeah, sure.
Go to your tent!

563
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:54,209
I think it's time we took this war
into our own hands.

564
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,605
Let me see what you got.

565
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,983
"From General Li. Dear son,
we're waiting for Huns at the pass.

566
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,360
"It would mean a lot
if you'd come and back us up."

567
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:23,071
That's great, except you forgot,
"And since we're out of potpourri,

568
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,407
"perhaps you wouldn't mind
bringing up some."

569
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,533
Hello! This is the army!

570
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,453
Make it sound more urgent!
Know what I'm talkin' about?

571
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,294
That's better. Much better. Let's go.

572
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:41,339
Khanny, baby. We need a ride.

573
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:50,474
Insubordinate ruffians!

574
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:54,311
You men owe me a new pair of slippers!

575
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:58,231
And I do not squeal like a girl.

576
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:01,234
Urgent news from the General.

577
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,072
What's the matter? You've never
seen a black and white before?

578
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:10,619
Who are you?

579
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:14,498
Excuse me?
I think the question is, who are you?

580
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:17,542
We're in a war, man !
There's no time for stupid questions!

581
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:21,129
I should have your hat for that.
Snatch it right off your head.

582
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:25,091
But I'm feeling gracious today,
so carry on before I report you.

583
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:33,350
Captain, urgent news from the General !
We're needed at the front.

584
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:37,354
Pack your bags, Cri-Kee.
We're movin' out.

585
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:41,358
For a long time
we've been marching off to battle

586
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:48,657
ln our thundering herd
we feeI a Iot Iike cattIe

587
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,493
Like a pounding beat
our aching feet

588
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,120
Aren't easy to ignore

589
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,206
Think of instead

590
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,043
A girl worth fighting for

591
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,587
That's what I said.

592
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,715
A girl worth fighting for

593
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,052
l want her paler than the moon

594
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,263
With eyes that shine like stars

595
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,391
My girl will marvel at my strength

596
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,143
Adore my battle scars

597
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:22,232
I couIdn't care Iess what she'II wear
or what she Iooks Iike

598
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,569
lt all depends on what she cooks like

599
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,780
Beef, pork, chicken

600
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,163
Bet the local girls
thought you were quite the charmer

601
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:42,919
And I'II bet the Iadies
Iove a man in armor

602
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:46,590
You can guess what
we have missed the most

603
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:49,092
Since we went off to war

604
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:53,638
-What do we want?
-A girl worth fighting for

605
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:56,975
My girl will think l have no faults

606
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,603
That l'm a major find

607
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:03,815
How 'bout a girl who's got a brain

608
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:07,736
Who always speaks her mind?

609
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,530
My manly ways and turn of phrase

610
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:13,074
Are sure to thriII her

611
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:18,288
He thinks he's such a lady killer

612
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:23,627
l've a girl back home
who's unlike any other

613
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,255
Yeah, the only girl
who'd Iove him is his mother

614
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:31,635
But when we come home in victory

615
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,638
They'll line up at the door

616
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:39,851
-What do we want?
-A girl worth fighting for

617
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:44,105
-Wish that I had
-A girl worth fighting for

618
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,401
A girl worth fighting...

619
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:19,307
Search for survivors.

620
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:53,550
I don't understand.
My father should've been here.

621
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,593
Captain !

622
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,149
The General.

623
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,316
I'm sorry.

624
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,879
The Huns are moving quickly.

625
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,633
We'll make better time to the Imperial
City through the Tung Shao Pass.

626
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,594
We're the only hope
for the Emperor now.

627
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,679
Move out!

628
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:14,357
What happened?

629
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:18,903
You just gave away our position !
Now we're. . .

630
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:24,409
Get out of range!

631
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,008
Save the cannons!

632
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:45,388
Come on ! Empty it! Empty it!

633
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,448
Sure. Save the horse.

634
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:22,675
Fire!

635
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,558
Hold the last cannon.

636
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,546
Prepare to fight.
If we die, we die with honor.

637
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,316
Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.

638
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,998
Ping ! Come back!

639
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,416
Ping !

640
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,349
Stop!

641
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,941
All right. You might want
to light that right about now.

642
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,609
Quickly. Quickly!

643
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:09,115
Come on ! We gotta help!

644
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:20,710
You missed ! How could you miss?

645
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,755
It was three feet in front of you !

646
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:33,116
Mulan !

647
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,951
Mulan?

648
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,953
No.

649
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,539
Mulan !

650
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:42,792
Man, you are one lucky bug.

651
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,720
Shang !

652
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:03,479
-Do you see them?
-Yes.

653
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:10,820
Perfect. Now we'll pull them to safety.

654
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:16,200
Mulan ! I found the lucky cricket!

655
00:58:16,285 --> 00:58:18,369
We need help.

656
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:24,000
Nice. Very nice. You can sit by me.

657
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:26,794
We're gonna die!

658
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,796
We're gonna die!
We are definitely gonna die.

659
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:31,924
No way we survive this.
Death is coming !

660
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,805
I let them slip through my fingers.

661
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,019
Pull !

662
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,325
I knew we could do it. You the man !

663
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,619
Sort of.

664
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,917
Step back, guys. Give him some air.

665
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:08,878
Ping?

666
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:12,965
You are the craziest man I've ever met.

667
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,844
And for that, I owe you my life.

668
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:20,389
From now on, you have my trust.

669
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:24,227
Let's hear it for Ping !
The bravest of us all !

670
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,062
You're king of the mountain !

671
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,897
Yes, yes, yes!

672
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,610
Ping ! What's wrong?

673
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:39,075
He's wounded ! Get help!

674
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:43,496
Ping, hold on.

675
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,207
Hold on.

676
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:16,904
I can explain.

677
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,616
So it's true!

678
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:22,910
Shang !

679
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:25,913
I knew there was
something wrong with you.

680
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:27,331
A woman !

681
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,460
Treacherous snake!

682
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:34,088
My name is Mulan.

683
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,632
I did it to save my father.

684
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:39,635
-High treason !
-I didn't mean for it to go this far.

685
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,971
Ultimate dishonor!

686
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,766
It was the only way. Please believe me.

687
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:47,893
Captain?

688
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,279
Restrain him !

689
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:03,576
-No!
-You know the law.

690
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,257
A life for a life.

691
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,593
My debt is repaid.

692
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:26,015
-Move out!
-But you can't just. . .

693
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:29,018
I said, "Move out."

694
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:06,764
I was this close.

695
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,975
This close to impressin' the ancestors,

696
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,853
gettin' the top shelf, an entourage.

697
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:16,649
Man. All my fine work.

698
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,363
Hi.

699
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:25,408
I should never have left home.

700
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:28,786
Come on.
You went to save your father's life.

701
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,414
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him
and disgracing your ancestors

702
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,250
and losin' all your friends?

703
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:37,586
You know, you just gotta. . .
You gotta learn to let these things go.

704
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,842
Maybe I didn't go for my father.

705
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:47,596
Maybe what I really wanted was
to prove I could do things right,

706
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:51,058
so when I looked in the mirror,

707
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:53,727
I'd see someone worthwhile.

708
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,940
But I was wrong.

709
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,569
I see nothing.

710
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:13,622
Now, that's just 'cause
this needs a little spit, that's all.

711
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:17,209
Let me shine this up for ya.

712
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:20,379
I can see you.
Look at you. You look so pretty.

713
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,928
The truth is, we're both frauds.

714
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:31,140
Your ancestors never sent me.
They don't even like me.

715
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,559
I mean, you risked your life
to help people you love.

716
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,978
I risked your life to help myself.

717
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,898
At least you had good intentions.

718
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:44,361
What? What do you mean,
"You're not lucky"?

719
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:47,656
You lied to me?

720
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:51,994
And what are you, a sheep?

721
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:56,165
I'll have to face my father
sooner or later.

722
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,667
Let's go home.

723
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:01,962
Yeah. This ain't gonna be pretty.

724
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:05,925
But don't you worry, okay?
Things will work out.

725
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:10,054
We started this thing together,
and that's how we'll finish it.

726
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:13,724
I promise.

727
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,475
Home is that way.

728
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,812
-I have to do something.
-Did you see those Huns?

729
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:44,857
They popped out of the snow. . .
Like daisies!

730
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,027
Are we in this together or not?

731
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:55,075
Let's go kick some Hunny buns!

732
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,077
Yee-haw!

733
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:20,184
Make way for the heroes of China.

734
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,867
-Shang !
-Mulan?

735
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:39,370
The Huns are alive! They're in the city!

736
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:42,122
You don't belong here, Mulan.
Go home.

737
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:48,879
Shang, I saw them in the mountains.
You have to believe me.

738
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:50,464
Why should I?

739
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,720
Why else would I come back?

740
01:06:56,805 --> 01:07:01,600
You said you'd trust Ping.
Why is Mulan any different?

741
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:13,612
Keep your eyes open.
I know they're here.

742
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:23,914
Now, where are you going?

743
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,625
To find someone who will believe me.

744
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:01,452
My children, heaven smiles down

745
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:03,704
upon the Middle Kingdom.

746
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:07,416
China will sleep safely tonight.

747
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,335
Thanks to our brave warriors.

748
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,758
Sir, the Emperor's in danger.

749
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,010
But the Huns are here.

750
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,971
Please, you have to help.

751
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:26,268
-No one will listen.
-I'm sorry. Did you say something?

752
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:30,314
-Mushu.
-You're a girl again, remember?

753
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:35,903
Your Majesty, I present to you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

754
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:39,448
I know what this means
to you, Captain Li.

755
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:43,118
Your father would have been
very proud.

756
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:13,148
-No!
-Come on !

757
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,918
They'll never reach the Emperor in time.

758
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:39,174
Guys!

759
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:41,677
I've got an idea.

760
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:57,484
Be a man

761
01:09:57,569 --> 01:10:01,780
-We must be swift as a coursing river
-Be a man

762
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:05,367
-With all the force of a great typhoon
-Be a man

763
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:09,037
With all the strength of a raging fire

764
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:13,876
Mysterious as the dark side
of the moon

765
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,601
Guard the door.

766
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:42,029
Your walls and armies have fallen,
and now it's your turn.

767
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:44,031
Bow to me.

768
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,454
Okay. Any questions?

769
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,581
Does this dress make me look fat?

770
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:56,835
Who's there?

771
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:03,008
-Concubines.
-Ugly concubines.

772
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,594
He's so cute!

773
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:19,733
Now, that's what I call
Mongolian barbecue.

774
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,961
Shang, go!

775
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:46,259
I tire of your arrogance, old man.
Bow to me!

776
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:52,099
No matter how the wind howls,
the mountain cannot bow to it.

777
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:55,811
Then you will kneel in pieces!

778
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:10,617
Chien-Po, get the Emperor!

779
01:12:10,702 --> 01:12:13,328
Sorry, Your Majesty.

780
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,291
No!

781
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:30,762
Come on !

782
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,112
No.

783
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:00,083
You !

784
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:05,172
-You took away my victory!
-No!

785
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:07,799
I did.

786
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,388
The soldier from the mountains.

787
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,734
So what's the plan?

788
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,986
You don't have a plan?

789
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:31,948
I'm making this up as I go.

790
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:34,409
-Mushu !
-Way ahead of you, sister.

791
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:36,828
Come on, Cri-Kee.

792
01:13:55,515 --> 01:13:59,017
-Citizens, I need firepower.
-Who are you?

793
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:01,520
Your worst nightmare.

794
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:08,026
-On the roof!
-Look!

795
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:27,379
It looks like you're out of ideas.

796
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:31,758
Not quite.

797
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:33,969
Ready, Mushu?

798
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:37,639
I am ready, baby! Light me.

799
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:54,406
Get off the roof, get off the roof,
get off the roof.

800
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:16,553
You are a lucky bug.

801
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:26,146
That was a deliberate attempt
on my life!

802
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,857
Where is she? Now she's done it.

803
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,276
What a mess! Stand aside!

804
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,321
That creature's not worth protecting.

805
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:36,364
-She's a hero.
-She's a woman.

806
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:39,659
-She'll never be worth anything.
-Listen, you pompous. . .

807
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:42,996
That is enough.

808
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,712
Your Majesty, I can explain.

809
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:02,224
I've heard a great deal
about you, Fa Mulan.

810
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:07,854
You stole your father's armor,
ran away from home,

811
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:10,148
impersonated a soldier,

812
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:12,567
deceived your commanding officer,

813
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:16,905
dishonored the Chinese army,
destroyed my palace

814
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,740
and

815
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,910
you have saved us all.

816
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,695
My little baby is all grown up
and savin' China.

817
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,697
You have a tissue?

818
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,617
Chi Fu?

819
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:04,327
Your Excellency?

820
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:07,747
See to it that this woman is made
a member of my council.

821
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:10,125
Member? What?

822
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:13,169
But. . . There are no
council positions open,

823
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:15,255
Your Majesty.

824
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:18,008
Very well. You can have his job.

825
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:21,136
What? I. . .

826
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:26,141
With all due respect, Your Excellency,

827
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:29,060
I think I've been away
from home long enough.

828
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:31,438
Then take this,

829
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:36,109
so your family will know
what you have done for me.

830
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,236
And this,

831
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:43,742
so the world will know
what you have done for China.

832
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,125
Is she allowed to do that?

833
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,142
You. . .

834
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,811
You fight good.

835
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:14,814
Thank you.

836
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,992
Khan, let's go home.

837
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:36,586
The flower that blooms in adversity

838
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:40,256
is the most rare and beautiful of all.

839
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:41,591
Sir?

840
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:45,720
You don't meet a girl like that
every dynasty.

841
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,002
Mulan !

842
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:21,840
Father, I brought you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

843
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,010
And the crest of the Emperor.

844
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:31,015
They're gifts to honor the Fa family.

845
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:43,153
The greatest gift and honor
is having you for a daughter.

846
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:46,281
I've missed you so.

847
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,825
I've missed you too, Baba.

848
01:19:54,999 --> 01:19:56,916
Great.

849
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:58,543
She brings home a sword.

850
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,587
If you ask me,
she should've brought home a man.

851
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:04,048
Excuse me. Does Fa Mulan live here?

852
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:07,677
Thank you.

853
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:11,264
Sign me up for the next war.

854
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:16,728
Honorable Fa Zhou, I. . . Mulan !

855
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,939
You forgot your helmet.

856
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:23,276
Well, actually, it's your helmet, isn't it?

857
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,489
-I mean. . .
-Would you like to stay for dinner?

858
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:30,325
Would you like to stay forever?

859
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,952
Dinner would be great.

860
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:38,958
Come on. Who did a good job?

861
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:41,336
Come on. Tell me. Who did a good job?

862
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:46,090
All right! You can be a guardian again.

863
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,185
Take it, Cri-Kee!

864
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:02,941
You know, she gets it
from my side of the family.

865
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:09,822
Call out for egg rolls!

866
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:13,618
Guardians.

867
01:21:14,662 --> 01:21:16,871
Thanks, Mushu.

868
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,462
Mushu !
