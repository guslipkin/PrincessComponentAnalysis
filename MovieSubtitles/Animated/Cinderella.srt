1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,934
Cinderella

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,115
You're as IoveIy as your name

3
00:00:20,537 --> 00:00:22,149
Cinderella

4
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:27,058
You're a sunset in a frame

5
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:30,396
Though you're dressed in rags

6
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:34,577
You wear an air of queenly grace

7
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:37,761
Anyone can see

8
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:42,517
A throne would be your proper place

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,663
Cinderella

10
00:00:46,737 --> 00:00:49,575
If you'll give your heart a chance

11
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:51,532
It will Iead you

12
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:56,710
To the kingdom of romance

13
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:03,768
There you'll see your dreams unfold

14
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:07,144
Cinderella

15
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,443
Cinderella

16
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:19,380
In the sweetest story ever told

17
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,028
Once upon a time... in a faraway Iand,

18
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:37,946
there was a tiny kingdom...

19
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:41,820
peaceful, prosperous,

20
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:44,083
and rich in romance and tradition.

21
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:49,914
Here, in a stately chateau,

22
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:51,947
there Iived a widowed gentleman...

23
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:53,942
and his IittIe daughter, Cinderella.

24
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:58,737
Although he was a kind and devoted father,

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,690
and gave his beloved child
every luxury and comfort,

26
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,299
still he felt she needed a mother's care.

27
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,638
And so he married again,

28
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:10,168
choosing for his second wife
a woman of good family...

29
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,968
with two daughters just Cinderella's age.

30
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:16,919
By name... Anastasia and Drizella.

31
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:22,097
It was upon the untimely death
of this good man, however,

32
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:24,744
that the stepmother's
true nature was revealed.

33
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:27,506
Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous...

34
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:29,884
of Cinderella's charm and beauty,

35
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:32,416
she was grimly determined
to forward the interests...

36
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:34,449
of her own two awkward daughters.

37
00:02:37,517 --> 00:02:39,129
Thus, as time went by,

38
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:41,392
the chateau fell into disrepair,

39
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:43,348
for the family fortunes were squandered...

40
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:45,841
upon the vain and selfish stepsisters,

41
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,987
while Cinderella was abused, humiliated,

42
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:52,439
and finally forced to become
a servant in her own house.

43
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:56,045
And yet, through it all,

44
00:02:56,735 --> 00:02:59,229
Cinderella remained ever gentle and kind,

45
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,256
for with each dawn she found
new hope that someday...

46
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:05,750
her dreams of happiness would come true.

47
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:48,942
Well, serves you right...
spoiling people's best dreams.

48
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:51,819
Yes, I know it's a IoveIy morning, but...

49
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:54,849
it was a IoveIy dream too.

50
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:00,603
What kind of a dream?

51
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,135
Uh-uh. Can't tell.

52
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,160
'Cause if you tell a wish,
it won't come true.

53
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:10,231
And after all...

54
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:14,221
A dream is a wish

55
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:17,635
Your heart makes

56
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:23,657
When you're fast asleep

57
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:30,753
In dreams, you will Iose
your heartaches

58
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:35,663
Whatever you wish for

59
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:38,694
You keep

60
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:43,373
Have faith in your dreams

61
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:47,823
And someday

62
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,920
Your rainbow will
come smiling through

63
00:04:55,725 --> 00:05:00,673
No matter how your heart is grieving

64
00:05:02,054 --> 00:05:06,082
If you keep on believing

65
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:10,493
The dream that you wish

66
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,861
Will come true

67
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:22,461
Oh, that clock! Old killjoy!

68
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:25,607
I hear you. "Come on, get up!" you say.

69
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:28,330
"Time to start another day."

70
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,399
Even he orders me around.

71
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,161
Well, there's one thing.

72
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,961
They can't order me to stop dreaming.

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,800
And perhaps someday...

74
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:44,096
The dreams that I wish

75
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:50,617
Will come true

76
00:06:05,193 --> 00:06:07,456
Shoo! Shoo! Hurry!

77
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:09,183
Come on, Jaq. Shoo!

78
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:21,381
Ia.Ia...ha.ha...Ia.Ia...

79
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,400
No matter how your heart is grieving

80
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:02,502
If you keep on believing

81
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:06,836
The dream that you wish

82
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:11,516
Will come true

83
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:13,434
Look what I found!

84
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:16,464
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

85
00:07:17,116 --> 00:07:18,459
One at a time, please!

86
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:20,914
Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?

87
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:22,717
New mouse in the house.

88
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:24,059
Brand-new. Never saw before.

89
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:27,128
- Visitor, visitor!
- Oh, a visitor.

90
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:29,238
Well, she'll need a dress.

91
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:33,841
- No, no, no.
- She's a he. He, he!

92
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:36,373
Oh, that does make a difference.

93
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:38,866
- He'll need a jacket, shoes...
- Gotta get out! Gotta get out!

94
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:40,592
- In a trap-trap!
- Trap-trap!

95
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,779
Where? In a trap?

96
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:44,812
Well, why didn't you say so?

97
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,577
Now, now, now... Calm down, everybody.

98
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:02,687
Oh...

99
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:04,835
The poor IittIe thing’s scared to death.

100
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:07,980
Jaq, maybe you'd better
explain things to him.

101
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:09,361
Zuk-zuk, Cinderelly. Zuk-zuk.

102
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,241
Now, now, now...

103
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:12,622
Look-a, IittIe guy.

104
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:15,230
Take it r-easy. Nothin' to worry 'bout.

105
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:16,688
We Iike-a you.

106
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:18,261
Cinderelly like you too. She's nice.

107
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:20,907
Very nice. That's-a better.

108
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:23,094
Come on, now. Zuk-zuk-zuk!

109
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,280
Za... za... zuk-zuk.

110
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,231
Well, that's better.

111
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:34,410
Well, let's just slip it on for size.

112
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:38,936
It is a IittIe snug,

113
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:40,701
but it'll have to do.

114
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:43,041
Now, for a name.

115
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:46,953
I've got one... Octavious!

116
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,293
But for short, we'll call you Gus.

117
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,748
Like it, Gus-Gus? Like it? Like it?

118
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:52,937
Uh... Gus-Gus.

119
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:54,702
Now I've got to hurry.

120
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:56,390
See that he keeps out of trouble, Jaq,

121
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:58,998
and don't forget to warn him about the cat.

122
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:02,105
Zuk-zuk. Look-a... uh, uh...
ever seen a cat-cat?

123
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,716
Duh... cat-cat?

124
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:05,404
Hup! Cat-cat! R-ucifee, that's-a him.

125
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:08,856
Mean...sneaky... Jump at you!

126
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:11,848
Jump at you! Ha! Big, Big! Big as a house!

127
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,492
Zuk-zuk... R-ucifee?

128
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:18,062
Duh... R-ucifee. Zuk-zuk.

129
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:50,591
Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

130
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,619
Come, kitty. Come on.

131
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:02,405
Lucifer! Come here!

132
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:21,853
I'm sorry if Your Highness
objects to an early breakfast.

133
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,191
It's certainly not my idea to feed you first.

134
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:28,720
It's orders. Come on.

135
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,249
Duh... R-ucifee. Is that a R-ucifee?

136
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,128
Zuk... R-ucifee. That's-a him!

137
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:37,581
Gus-Gus take-a R-ucifee and...

138
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:40,534
Look-it.

139
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:41,685
Wait! No, Gus-Gus, no!

140
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:43,910
Now, Iisten here. R-ucifee not-a funny.

141
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,444
R-ucifee mean.

142
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:00,328
Bruno...

143
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:03,665
Bruno!

144
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:11,989
Dreaming again.

145
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:14,060
Chasing Lucifer?

146
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:15,901
Catch him this time?

147
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:17,781
That's bad!

148
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:22,269
Suppose they heard you upstairs?

149
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:23,880
You know the orders.

150
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,447
So if you don’t want to Iose a nice warm bed,

151
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:29,365
you'd better get rid of those dreams.

152
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:31,859
You know how?

153
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:35,119
Just Iearn to Iike cats.

154
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:39,185
No, I mean it.

155
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:40,950
Lucifer has his good points too.

156
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:43,251
For one thing, he...

157
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:48,123
Well...Sometimes he...

158
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:50,309
Hmm...

159
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:53,685
There must be something good about him.

160
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:07,341
Bruno!

161
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,872
Oh, Bruno.

162
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,018
Come on now, outside.

163
00:12:16,163 --> 00:12:17,583
I know it isn't easy,

164
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:20,536
but at Ieast we should
try to get along together.

165
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:26,098
And that includes you, Your Majesty!

166
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:36,033
Breakfast time! Everybody up!

167
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:37,337
Hurry, hurry!

168
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:39,217
Come on, everybody. Breakfast, breakfast!

169
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,516
- Come on, everybody, breakfee!- Breakfast!

170
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,434
Breakfast?

171
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,661
Ooh, breakfast!

172
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:46,889
Oh-oh!

173
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:59,317
R-ucifee! How we gonna get out?

174
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,422
Hup-hup... carefee!

175
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,411
Listen, everybody! Got an idea.

176
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:10,288
Now, somebody gotta sneak out.

177
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:12,244
Let R-ucifee chase him.

178
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:15,390
Run over to a corner and beat R-ucifee there.

179
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:17,001
Then we all run out. Zuk?

180
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:18,228
Zuk-zuk, out!

181
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,415
Now we choose the one that do it.

182
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:22,179
Everybody, hup!

183
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:23,905
- Hup!
- Uh, hup.

184
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:25,401
- R-ails up!
- Hup!

185
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:28,739
Now...

186
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:29,813
Hup, hup, hup!

187
00:13:30,657 --> 00:13:32,459
Uh, duh... uh, hup!

188
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:16,642
Oh, there you are.

189
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:18,138
I was wondering.

190
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,437
All right, breakfast is served.

191
00:15:32,101 --> 00:15:35,093
Uh... take it r-easy. Zuk-zuk.

192
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:39,389
Uh, duh... Iet go! Let go now!

193
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:41,768
Let... go...

194
00:15:42,305 --> 00:15:46,524
Stop that. Shoo, shoo, shoo.
Go on! Shoo, shoo, shoo!

195
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,746
Poor IittIe Gus.

196
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:51,664
Here.

197
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:53,084
Help yourself.

198
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:30,477
Hmm... No Gus-gus.

199
00:17:31,513 --> 00:17:34,390
Well, guess he got away.

200
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,068
Cinderella!

201
00:17:56,906 --> 00:18:00,052
I'm coming. Oh, my goodness.

202
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:01,241
Morning, noon, and night.

203
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:03,888
- Cinderella!
- Coming!

204
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:05,998
Coming!

205
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:15,050
Cinderella!

206
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:17,582
I'm coming.

207
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:30,087
- Cinderella!
- In a minute.

208
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:32,657
Cinderella!

209
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,773
Cinderella!

210
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,247
Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?

211
00:19:25,477 --> 00:19:27,012
As if you cared.

212
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:29,582
Take that ironing and
have it back in an hour.

213
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:31,116
One hour!

214
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:32,996
- You hear?
- Yes, Drizella.

215
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,240
Good morning, Anastasia.

216
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, it's about time!
Don't forget the mending.

217
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:49,068
And don't be all day getting it done, either!

218
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:50,449
Yes, Anastasia.

219
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:54,362
- A-a-ahem.
- Well, come in, child.

220
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:57,354
- Come in.
- Good morning, Stepmother.

221
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,809
Pick up the laundry
and get on with your duties.

222
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:00,998
Yes, Stepmother.

223
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,602
Mother! Oh, Mother, Mother!

224
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,983
Mother! You did it!

225
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:23,745
You did it on purpose! Mother!

226
00:20:24,282 --> 00:20:25,701
Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother!

227
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:26,929
- Now what did you do?
- Oh!

228
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:29,537
She put it there!

229
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,726
A big ugly mouse...

230
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,030
under my teacup!

231
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:34,792
All right, Lucifer.

232
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:36,633
What did you do with him?

233
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,472
Oh, you're not fooling anybody.

234
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:41,045
We'll just see about this.

235
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,576
Come on! Let him go.

236
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:48,755
Now the other one. Come on! Oh...

237
00:20:49,254 --> 00:20:50,366
poor IittIe Gus.

238
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:58,114
Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever Iearn?

239
00:20:58,306 --> 00:20:59,150
Cinderella!

240
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:00,608
Yes, Stepmother.

241
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,817
- Are you gonna get it!
- Close the door, Cinderella.

242
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:17,294
Come here.

243
00:21:31,564 --> 00:21:32,638
Oh, please, you don't think--

244
00:21:33,021 --> 00:21:33,980
Hold your tongue!

245
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,128
Now...

246
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:41,000
It seems we have time on our hands.

247
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,841
- But I was only trying to--
- Silence!

248
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:48,595
Time for vicious practical jokes.

249
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:51,971
Perhaps we can put it to better use.

250
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:54,234
Now... Iet me see.

251
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:58,108
There’s the large carpet in the main hall.

252
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,949
Clean it!

253
00:22:00,793 --> 00:22:02,826
And the windows, upstairs and down.

254
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,514
Wash them!

255
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:06,585
Oh, yes...

256
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,117
and the tapestries, and the draperies.

257
00:22:09,424 --> 00:22:10,997
- But I just fin--
- Do them again!

258
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:13,337
And don't forget...

259
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,676
the garden... then scrub
the terrace... sweep the halls...

260
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:17,287
and the stairs... clean the chimneys.

261
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:18,707
And of course, there's the mending,

262
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,318
and the sewing, and the laundry.

263
00:22:24,998 --> 00:22:27,376
Oh, yes, and one more thing.

264
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:30,982
See that Lucifer gets his bath.

265
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,778
- But, but, but--
- No "buts" about it!

266
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,038
My son has been avoiding
his responsibilities long enough!

267
00:22:53,844 --> 00:22:56,452
It's high time he married and settled down.

268
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,370
Of course, Your Majesty.

269
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,321
- But we must be patient.
- I am patient!

270
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:08,113
But I’m not getting any younger, you know.

271
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,681
I want to see my grandchildren before I go.

272
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:13,330
I understand, Sire.

273
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,782
No, no, you don't know
what it means to see...

274
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:19,429
your only child grow farther...

275
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,150
farther... and farther away from you.

276
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,175
I'm IoneIy in this desolate old palace.

277
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:29,709
I...

278
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:33,584
I want to hear the pitter-patter
of IittIe feet again.

279
00:23:35,348 --> 00:23:36,652
Now, now, Your Majesty.

280
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:39,491
Perhaps if we just Iet him alone.

281
00:23:41,102 --> 00:23:42,329
Let him alone?

282
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,437
W-w-with his silly romantic ideas?

283
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:48,429
But, but, Sire, in matters of love--

284
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,040
Love... Ha!

285
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,991
Just a boy meeting a girl
under the right conditions.

286
00:23:54,873 --> 00:23:57,059
So, we're arranging the conditions.

287
00:23:57,788 --> 00:24:00,320
But, but, Your Majesty,
if the Prince should suspect--

288
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:00,972
Suspect?

289
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:02,583
Ha! Look...

290
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:05,038
the boy's coming home today, isn't he?

291
00:24:05,268 --> 00:24:06,074
Yes, Sire.

292
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:08,298
Well, what could be
more natural than a ball...

293
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,022
- to celebrate his return?
- N-n-nothing, Sire.

294
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:14,743
If all the eligible maidens
in my kingdom just...

295
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,310
happened to be there,

296
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:22,261
why he's bound to show
interest in one of them, isn't he?

297
00:24:23,757 --> 00:24:24,486
Isn't he?

298
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:26,212
Y-y-yes, Sire.

299
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:28,092
The moment he does...

300
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:32,772
soft Iights, romantic music,

301
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,533
all the trimmings.

302
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:38,219
It can't possibly fail.

303
00:24:39,753 --> 00:24:40,482
Can it?

304
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:43,627
Y-y-yes, Sire. N-n-no, Sire.

305
00:24:43,972 --> 00:24:47,041
Very well, Sire. I shall
arrange the ball for--

306
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:48,384
Tonight!

307
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:51,683
- Tonight? Oh, but, Sire--
- Tonight!

308
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:54,866
And see that every eligible maid is there!

309
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:57,897
Understand?

310
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

311
00:25:02,883 --> 00:25:05,530
The pear-shaped tones.

312
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:10,555
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

313
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:13,662
Sing sweet nightingale

314
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:17,613
High...

315
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:19,608
Above me

316
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:23,866
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

317
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:27,203
Sing sweet nightingale

318
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,576
High...

319
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:34,299
Above...

320
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:38,250
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

321
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:41,242
Sing sweet nightingale

322
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:48,224
High...

323
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,290
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

324
00:25:53,747 --> 00:26:00,000
Sing sweet nightingale

325
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,756
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

326
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:08,861
Sing...sweet...

327
00:26:09,475 --> 00:26:12,965
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

328
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:16,840
Sing...

329
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:21,097
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

330
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:26,890
Oh, sing sweet...

331
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:29,268
Oh...

332
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:32,759
Sing...

333
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:35,751
Oh! Oh, Lucifer!

334
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:40,737
You mean old thing!

335
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,266
I'm just going to have to...

336
00:26:44,381 --> 00:26:45,417
teach you a Iesson.

337
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,447
Open in the name of the King!

338
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:52,897
An urgent message from His Imperial Majesty.

339
00:26:53,703 --> 00:26:55,429
- Thank you.
- From the King!

340
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:56,886
What's it say, Cinderelly?

341
00:26:57,308 --> 00:26:58,996
Duh... uh... uh... What's it say, huh?

342
00:26:59,572 --> 00:27:00,415
I don’t know.

343
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:02,870
He said it’s urgent.

344
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:06,745
Maybe I should interrupt the... uh...

345
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:08,010
music Iesson.

346
00:27:08,202 --> 00:27:09,622
Oh, sing sweet nightingale

347
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,614
Sing sweet nightingale

348
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:18,291
High...

349
00:27:20,132 --> 00:27:22,088
You clumsy! You did it on purpose.

350
00:27:22,242 --> 00:27:23,277
- Be still, you!
- You're always--

351
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:24,888
- Girls, girls!- It's her fault, Mother.

352
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,886
Above all...

353
00:27:26,193 --> 00:27:27,689
self-control.

354
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:30,642
Yes!

355
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:34,286
Cinderella!

356
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:35,399
I've warned you
never to interrupt while--

357
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:37,087
But this just arrived from the palace.

358
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:38,314
From the palace!

359
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:39,848
- Give it here!- Let me have it!

360
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,038
- No, it's mine!
- No--

361
00:27:41,114 --> 00:27:41,958
I'll read it.

362
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,876
Well...

363
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:45,641
- There's to be a ball.- A ball!

364
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:47,827
In honour of His Highness, the Prince!

365
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:48,978
Oh, the Prince!

366
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:50,627
And by royal command,

367
00:27:51,318 --> 00:27:53,965
every eligible maiden is to attend.

368
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:56,343
- Why, that's us!
- And I'm so eligible!

369
00:27:58,568 --> 00:28:00,371
Why, that means I can go too!

370
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:03,593
Ha! Her, dancing with the Prince!

371
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:06,355
I'd be honoured, Your Highness.

372
00:28:06,738 --> 00:28:08,694
Would you mind holding my broom?

373
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:14,065
Well, why not?

374
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:17,862
After all, I'm still a member of the family.

375
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:20,739
And it says, "By royal command...

376
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,539
every eligible maiden is to attend."

377
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:26,225
Yes... So it does.

378
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:30,214
Well, I see no reason why you can't go...

379
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,359
if you get all your work done.

380
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,469
Oh, I will! I promise.

381
00:28:35,738 --> 00:28:37,425
And if you can find something...

382
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:38,614
suitable to wear.

383
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:40,072
I'm sure I can!

384
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:41,875
Oh, thank you, Stepmother.

385
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:45,442
Mother! Do you realize what you just said?

386
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:47,245
Of course.

387
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,777
I said, "If..."

388
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:52,539
Oh, "If..."

389
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:03,816
Isn't it IoveIy? It was my mother's.

390
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,389
It's pretty-pretty, but it’s old.

391
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:08,266
Well, maybe it is a little
old-fashioned, but...

392
00:29:08,573 --> 00:29:09,494
oh, I'll fix that.

393
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:11,680
H-H-How you do that, huh?

394
00:29:11,948 --> 00:29:13,214
Wait a minute.

395
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:14,288
There ought to be...

396
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:15,286
some good ideas in here.

397
00:29:16,245 --> 00:29:17,511
Uh-huh.

398
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:19,122
This one.

399
00:29:19,198 --> 00:29:20,771
- Oh, very nice-nice.
- Like it!

400
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:21,845
- We can do it.- It'll be R-easy.

401
00:29:22,075 --> 00:29:24,147
I'll have to shorten
the sleeves... I'll need a sash...

402
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,180
a ruffle... and something for a collar.

403
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:27,829
- And then I'll--
- Cinderella!

404
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,670
Oh, now what do they want?

405
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,358
- Cinderella!
- Cinderella!

406
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:35,463
Oh, well, guess my dress
will just have to wait.

407
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:38,301
- Cinderella!
- Cinderella!

408
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,986
All right, all right! I'm coming.

409
00:29:44,592 --> 00:29:46,050
Poor Cinderelly.

410
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,159
Every time she find a minute,

411
00:29:48,428 --> 00:29:49,655
that's the time when they begin it!

412
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:53,453
- Cinderelly, Cinderelly--
- Cinderella!

413
00:29:55,524 --> 00:29:56,867
Cinderelly, Cinderelly

414
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:58,516
Night and day it's Cinderelly

415
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,127
Make the fire, fix the breakfast

416
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:01,930
Wash the dishes, do the mopping

417
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:03,733
And the sweeping and the dusting

418
00:30:04,117 --> 00:30:05,728
They always keep her hoppin'

419
00:30:06,035 --> 00:30:07,454
She go around in circles

420
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,142
'TiI she's very, very dizzy

421
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:10,216
Still they holler

422
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,364
Keep-a busy, Cinderelly

423
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,509
Yeah...Keep-a busy.

424
00:30:18,655 --> 00:30:19,614
You know what?

425
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:21,992
Cinderelly's not go to the ball.

426
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:23,104
What?

427
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,524
- Not go?
- What did you say?

428
00:30:25,636 --> 00:30:28,513
You'll see. They fix her.

429
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:31,582
Work, work, work.

430
00:30:32,234 --> 00:30:33,807
She'll never get her dress done.

431
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,684
P-p-poor Cinderelly.

432
00:30:38,563 --> 00:30:40,328
Hey! We can do it!

433
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:42,169
We can do it we can do it

00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:45,775
We can make the dress so pretty

436
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:47,616
There’s nothing to it, really

437
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,920
We'll tie a sash around it

438
00:30:49,457 --> 00:30:51,107
Put a ribbon through it

439
00:30:51,528 --> 00:30:52,679
When dancing at the ball

440
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:54,367
She'll be more beautiful than all

441
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:57,628
In the IoveIy dress we'll make for Cinderelly

442
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,776

I'll cut it with the scissors

447
00:31:07,102 --> 00:31:08,598
And I can do the sewing

448
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,286
Leave the sewing to the women

449
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:12,281
You go get some trimmin'

450

Find a pretty-pretty if we can.

454
00:31:23,712 --> 00:31:25,706
Ho-ho-ho. Cinderelly needs help.

455
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:28,276
Surprise, surprise! Pretty
surprise for Cinderelly!

456
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,247
- And this too, Cinderella,
my slippers. Now don't forget-

457
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,395
- Cinderella, take my dress!
- Here, mend the buttonholes.

458
00:31:41,856 --> 00:31:43,658
Press my skirt too, and mind
the ruffle. You're always--

459
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:45,423
- And, Cinderella...
- Yes?

460
00:31:45,691 --> 00:31:48,875
When you're through, and before
you begin your regular chores,

461
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:50,870
I have a few IittIe things.

462
00:31:51,253 --> 00:31:53,670
- Very well.
- Mother I don't see why...

463
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:55,741
everybody else seems to have
such nice things to wear...

464
00:31:55,818 --> 00:31:57,468
and I always end up in these old rags.

465
00:31:57,928 --> 00:31:58,810
This sash!

466
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:00,690
Why, I wouldn’t be seen dead in it!

467
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:04,449
You should talk! These beads!
I'm sick of looking at them!

468
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:08,247
- Trash! Oh, I hate--
- I don't see why I can't have-

469
00:32:10,356 --> 00:32:11,277
Come on! Now, be carefee.

470

Duh... uh... yes-yes-yes, real carefee.

00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:28,462
Uh... pretty-pretty

473
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:29,843
Shhh! Look-it!

00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:31,185
R-ucifee!

475
00:33:12,344 --> 00:33:15,106
Uh... duh... duh... Iook.

476
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:17,945
Oh, beads! Oh-ho-ho-ho!

00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:19,172
Very pretty beads! Oh-ho-ho!

478
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:20,170
Shhh!

479
00:35:19,696 --> 00:35:22,075
A dream is a wish your heart makes

480
00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:25,604
When you're fast asleep

481
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:29,478
In dreams you will Iose your heartaches

482
00:35:30,437 --> 00:35:32,930
Whatever you wish for you keep

483
00:35:36,152 --> 00:35:39,144
Have faith in your dreams and someday

484
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:45,243
No matter how your heart is grieving

485
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:47,200
If you keep on believing

486
00:35:47,737 --> 00:35:50,192
The dream that you wish will come true

487
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:07,146
Okay. 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8.

488
00:36:09,026 --> 00:36:11,443
Whatever you wish for you keep.

489
00:36:13,821 --> 00:36:15,010
All right.

490
00:36:17,273 --> 00:36:18,501
Heave-ho, heave-ho!

491
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:20,304
Heave-ho.

492
00:36:23,027 --> 00:36:23,948
Mmmm mm mm believing

493
00:36:24,255 --> 00:36:26,057
The dream that you wish will come...

494
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:29,855
Will come true...

495
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:27,969
Yes?

496
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:29,964
- The carriage is here.
- Oh.

497
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,838
Why, Cinderella, you're not ready, child.

498
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,411
I'm not going.

499
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:38,633
Not going? Oh, what a shame.

500
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,934
But of course, there will be...

501
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:43,504
- other times, and--
- Yes. Good night.

502
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,544
Oh, well. What's a royal ball?

503
00:37:59,922 --> 00:38:01,341
After all, I suppose it would be...

504
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,528
frightfully dull... and... and boring...

505
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:05,446
and... and completely...

506
00:38:07,172 --> 00:38:08,591
completely wonderful.

507
00:38:15,074 --> 00:38:17,222
Oh, why... it’s my...

508
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:18,871
Surprise!

509
00:38:18,948 --> 00:38:19,945
Surprise! Surprise!

510
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,707
- Surprise!
- Duh... duh... Happy birthday!

511
00:38:23,283 --> 00:38:25,316
- No, no, no, no!
- Why, I never dreamed...

512
00:38:26,505 --> 00:38:27,656
It's such a surprise!

513
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,612
Oh!

514
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:32,029
How can I ever...why...

515
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,059
Oh, thank you so much!

516
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,380
Now remember, when you're
presented to His Highness,

517
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:46,030
- be sure--
- Wait!

518
00:38:47,295 --> 00:38:48,178
Please... wait for me!

519
00:38:49,865 --> 00:38:50,633
Isn't it IoveIy?

520
00:38:51,438 --> 00:38:52,973
Do you Iike it?

521
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:54,622
Do you think it will do?

522
00:38:56,271 --> 00:38:58,266
- Cinderella!
- Mother, she can't!

523
00:38:58,726 --> 00:38:59,685
- You wouldn't--
- Oh, no! You...

524
00:38:59,762 --> 00:39:01,105
- can't Iet her!
- Girls, please!

525
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:05,056
After all, we did make a bargain.

526
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:06,974
Didn't we, Cinderella?

527
00:39:09,544 --> 00:39:12,075
And I never go back on my word.

528
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,221
How very clever,

529
00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:17,407
these beads.

530
00:39:18,405 --> 00:39:20,361
They give it just the right touch.

531
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,353
Don't you think so, Drizella?

532
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:24,926
No, I don't! I think she's--

533
00:39:26,153 --> 00:39:28,224
Why you IittIe thief!

534
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,178
They’re my beads! Give them here!

535
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:32,291
Oh, no!

536
00:39:32,597 --> 00:39:35,666
Oh... and Iook, that's my sash!
Wearing my sash! She can't!

537
00:39:36,203 --> 00:39:37,891
Oh, don't! Please, stop!

538
00:39:38,428 --> 00:39:40,691
- My ribbon!
- Why, you thief!

539
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,261
- Kitchen wench!
- You ungrateful IittIe--

540
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:44,834
Girls, girls.

541
00:39:46,215 --> 00:39:46,982
That's quite enough.

542
00:39:47,672 --> 00:39:49,053
Hurry along now, both of you.

543
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,393
I won’t have you upsetting yourselves.

544
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:57,454
Good night.

545
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:39,534
In dreams you will Iose your heartaches

546
00:40:41,068 --> 00:40:44,252
Whatever you wish for you keep

547
00:40:44,674 --> 00:40:47,129
Oh, no. No, it isn't true.

548
00:40:47,743 --> 00:40:51,655
Have faith in your dreams and someday

549
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:53,650
It's just no use.

550
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,182
Your rainbow will come smiling through

551
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:57,908
No use at all.

552
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:02,511
No matter how your heart is grieving

553
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:06,078
If you keep on believing

554
00:41:06,692 --> 00:41:10,490
- I can't believe, not anymore.
- The dreams that you wish...

555
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:14,863
There’s nothing left to believe in.

556
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:16,627
Nothing.

557
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:18,507
Nothing, my dear?

558
00:41:19,581 --> 00:41:21,537
Oh, now you don't really mean that.

559
00:41:21,806 --> 00:41:23,839
- Oh, but I do!- Nonsense, child!

560
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,214
If you'd Iost all your faith,
I couldn’t be here,

561
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:28,825
and here I am!

562
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,702
Oh, come now. Dry those tears.

563
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:34,848
You can't go to the ball looking like that.

564
00:41:35,116 --> 00:41:37,686
The ball? Oh, but I'm not--
- Of course you are.

565
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:39,527
But we'll have to hurry,

566
00:41:40,103 --> 00:41:41,867
because even miracles take a little time.

567
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:44,437
- Miracles?
- Uh-hmm. Watch.

568
00:41:45,972 --> 00:41:47,775
What in the world did I do
with that magic wand?

569
00:41:48,312 --> 00:41:49,884
- I was sure I--
- Magic wand?

570
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:52,531
That's strange... I... I always--

571
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:54,181
Why then, you must be--

572
00:41:54,296 --> 00:41:56,866
Your Fairy Godmother? Of course.

573
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:59,167
Where is that wand? I--

574
00:42:00,088 --> 00:42:01,814
Oh! I forgot.

575
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:03,809
I put it away.

576
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,719
- Look-a what she did!
- Duh... duh... How'd she do it

577
00:42:09,371 --> 00:42:10,982
Now... let's see. Hmm...

578
00:42:12,248 --> 00:42:16,007
I'd say the first thing
you need is, um... a pumpkin.

579
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:18,615
- But... a pumpkin?
- Uh-huh. Now, um...

580
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:20,418
Now... the magic words.

581
00:42:21,262 --> 00:42:22,183
Uh... Oh...

582
00:42:23,295 --> 00:42:24,331
Ahem!

583
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:27,783
Salaga doola menchicka boola

584
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:29,739
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

585
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,118
Put them together and what have you got

586
00:42:32,578 --> 00:42:33,997
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

587
00:42:34,956 --> 00:42:36,414
Salaga doola menchicka boola

588
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:38,485
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

589
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:40,710
It'll do magic believe it or not

590
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,896
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

591
00:42:43,318 --> 00:42:44,277
Now salaga doola means

592
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:47,346
Menchicka boola roo

593
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:49,801
But the thing-a-ma-bob that does the job

594
00:42:50,185 --> 00:42:51,911
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

595
00:42:52,525 --> 00:42:54,251
Oh, salaga doola menchicka boola

596
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:56,284
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

597
00:42:57,013 --> 00:42:58,700
Put them together and what have you got

598
00:42:59,122 --> 00:42:59,928
Bibbidi-bobbidi

599
00:43:00,388 --> 00:43:02,421
Bibbidi-bobbidi Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

600
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:05,912
- Oh, Iooky, Iooky.
- Isn't it wonderfee?

601
00:43:06,065 --> 00:43:07,063
Isn't it, huh?

602
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:09,709
Oh, it's beautiful!

603
00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:12,241
Yes, isn't it?

604
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,195
Now, with an elegant
coach like that, of course,

605
00:43:15,502 --> 00:43:18,724
we'll simply have to have... uh...mice!

606
00:43:18,954 --> 00:43:20,488
Uh... uh... mice?

607
00:43:20,987 --> 00:43:22,521
Oh, this really is nice.

608
00:43:23,595 --> 00:43:25,590
Why, we'll have a coach-and-fou
when we're through.

609
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,697
Just a wave of my stick,
and to finish the trick,

610
00:43:29,618 --> 00:43:30,692
Bibbidi.. bobbidi...

611
00:43:31,037 --> 00:43:32,226
boo!

612
00:43:32,418 --> 00:43:33,454
Gracious, what did I do?

613
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:35,947
I was sure there were four there.

614
00:43:36,254 --> 00:43:37,635
There should be one more.

615
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,051
Oh, ha-ha. There you are.

616
00:43:41,547 --> 00:43:42,890
Bibbidi... bobbidi...

617
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,849
boo!

618
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:54,590
- Shoo!- Oh, poor Lucifer.

619
00:43:55,817 --> 00:43:56,853
Serves him right, I'd say.

620
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:58,425
Now... um... where were we?

621
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,768
Oh, goodness, yes.

622
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:02,722
You can't go to the ball without... um...

623
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:04,103
a horse!

624
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,251
A-a-another one?

625
00:44:07,018 --> 00:44:09,780
But tonight, for a change,
you'll handle the reins...

626
00:44:10,393 --> 00:44:12,235
and sit in the driver's seat too.

627
00:44:13,194 --> 00:44:15,917
For instead of a horse,
why the coachman, of course.

628
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:18,526
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

629
00:44:21,748 --> 00:44:23,359
Well, that does it, I guess.

630
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:26,773
Except for-- oh, yes,
the finishing touch...

631
00:44:27,118 --> 00:44:30,378
and that's you. Yes, Bruno, that's right!

632
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:31,990
You'll be footman tonight.

633
00:44:32,872 --> 00:44:34,751
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

634
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:38,664
Well, well, hop in, my dear.
We can't waste time.

635
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:40,007
- But... uh--
- Now, now, now...

636
00:44:40,198 --> 00:44:41,426
don't try to thank me.

637
00:44:41,886 --> 00:44:44,686
Oh, I wasn't-- I mean... I do, but...

638
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,446
- but don't you think my dress-
- Yes, it's lovely, dear.

639
00:44:48,944 --> 00:44:53,010
Lov-- Good heavens, child!
You can't go in that.

640
00:44:55,158 --> 00:44:56,578
Now, uh.. let’s see, dear.

641
00:44:57,498 --> 00:45:00,414
Your size... and the shade
of your eyes... Uh-hmm.

642
00:45:01,641 --> 00:45:03,866
Something simple, but daring too.

643
00:45:04,633 --> 00:45:06,398
Oh, just Ieave it to me!

644
00:45:06,551 --> 00:45:07,740
What a gown this will be.

645
00:45:08,546 --> 00:45:10,847
Bibbidi-bobbidi bibbidi-bobbidi...

646
00:45:11,077 --> 00:45:14,875
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

647
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:17,368
Oh, it's a beautiful dress!

648
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:20,514
Did you ever see such a beautiful dress?

649
00:45:21,741 --> 00:45:23,698
And Iook, glass slippers.

650
00:45:25,731 --> 00:45:27,227
Why, it's Iike a dream,

651
00:45:27,879 --> 00:45:30,142
a wonderful dream come true.

652
00:45:30,947 --> 00:45:33,402
Yes, my child, but like all dreams,

653
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:36,279
well, I'm afraid this can't last forever.

654
00:45:37,123 --> 00:45:38,964
You'll have only
'tiI midnight and then--

655
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:41,765
- Midnight? Oh, thank you.
- Oh, now, now just a minute.

656
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,491
You must understand, my dear.

657
00:45:44,181 --> 00:45:46,598
On the stroke of twelve,
the spell will be broken,

658
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,014
and everything will be as it was before.

659
00:45:49,436 --> 00:45:50,587
Oh, I understand, but...

660
00:45:51,853 --> 00:45:53,924
it's more than I ever hoped for.

661
00:45:54,615 --> 00:45:55,612
Bless you, my child.

662
00:45:56,226 --> 00:45:59,371
I-- Goodness me! It's getting Iate!

663
00:45:59,832 --> 00:46:01,635
Hurry up, dear. The ball can't wait.

664
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:04,358
Have a good time, dance, be gay!

665
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,123
Now, off you go. You're on your way.

666
00:46:06,314 --> 00:46:08,079
With a bibbidi-bobbidi, bibbidi-bobbidi...

667
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:09,920
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

668
00:46:36,618 --> 00:46:39,994
The Princess Fredrica
Eugenie de Ia Fontaine.

669
00:46:44,827 --> 00:46:46,975
M'amselle Augustina Dubois,

670
00:46:47,896 --> 00:46:50,657
the daughter of General Pierre Dubois.

671
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:02,932
Ah... the boy isn't cooperating.

672
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:07,727
M'amselle Leanora Mercedes de la Torre,

673
00:47:08,456 --> 00:47:12,254
daughter of Colonel and Madam de la Torre.

674
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:20,999
I can't understand it!

675
00:47:21,575 --> 00:47:24,030
There must be at Ieast one
who'd make a suitable mother.

676
00:47:24,643 --> 00:47:25,756
Shhh! Sire!

677
00:47:26,523 --> 00:47:28,096
Uh... a suitable wife.

678
00:47:46,968 --> 00:47:51,495
The Mademoiselles Drizella
and Anastasia Tremain,

679
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:54,985
daughters of Lady Tremain.

680
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:01,660
I give up!

681
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,345
Even I couldn’t expect the boy to--

682
00:48:04,575 --> 00:48:06,110
Well, if I may say so, Your Majesty.

683
00:48:06,378 --> 00:48:11,441
I did try to warn you, but you,
Sire, are incurably romantic.

684
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:16,236
No doubt you saw the whole
pretty picture in detail.

685
00:48:17,234 --> 00:48:18,193
The young Prince...

686
00:48:19,037 --> 00:48:20,456
bowing to the assembly.

687
00:48:21,453 --> 00:48:22,412
Suddenly, he stops.

688
00:48:23,103 --> 00:48:24,714
He Iooks up, for Io,

689
00:48:26,286 --> 00:48:29,509
there she stands, the girl of his dreams.

690
00:48:31,733 --> 00:48:33,766
Who she is, or whence she came...

691
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:35,915
he knows not, nor does he care.

692
00:48:36,797 --> 00:48:38,408
But his heart tells him that here...

693
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,548
here is the maid predestined to be his bride.

694
00:48:45,658 --> 00:48:48,036
A pretty plot for fairytales, Sire,

695
00:48:48,765 --> 00:48:51,373
but in real Life... oh, no... no.

696
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:53,713
It was foredoomed to failure.

697
00:48:54,212 --> 00:48:55,171
Failure, eh?

698
00:48:56,782 --> 00:48:59,429
Take a Iook at that, you pompous windbag!

699
00:49:01,615 --> 00:49:02,919
Who is she? You know her?

700
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,684
No, Sire.

701
00:49:04,837 --> 00:49:06,218
I've never seen her before.

702
00:49:07,062 --> 00:49:08,328
That's one thing in her favour.

703
00:49:08,827 --> 00:49:10,438
The waltz. Quick, the waltz!

704
00:49:13,928 --> 00:49:15,041
Soft Iights.

705
00:49:15,885 --> 00:49:16,729
The Iights!

706
00:49:35,946 --> 00:49:37,634
Aha! Failure, eh!

707
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,037
Well...now for a good night's sleep.

708
00:49:45,536 --> 00:49:47,608
Quite so, Sire. I believe I too--

709
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:49,372
You will stay right here.

710
00:49:50,484 --> 00:49:51,482
See they're not disturbed.

711
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:53,438
And when the boy proposes...

712
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,008
notify me immediately!

713
00:49:57,312 --> 00:49:58,962
- Notify me immed--
- And remember...

714
00:50:00,304 --> 00:50:01,954
if anything goes wrong...

715
00:50:03,987 --> 00:50:13,692
Ia...ha...

716
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:20,328
- But who is she, Mother?
- Do we know her?

717
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:22,207
certainly seems to.

718
00:50:23,397 --> 00:50:24,701
But I know I've never seen her.

719
00:50:25,161 --> 00:50:26,619
Nor I.

720
00:50:26,734 --> 00:50:28,153
But she certainly is-- Wait...

721
00:50:30,301 --> 00:50:32,219
there is something familiar about her.

722
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:40,850
Ahem.

723
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:54,391
So this is love

724
00:50:57,383 --> 00:50:59,377
So this is love

725
00:51:01,947 --> 00:51:04,786
So this is what makes life

726
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,468
Worthwhile

727
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:09,888
I'm all aglow

728
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:13,608
And now I know

729
00:51:14,452 --> 00:51:15,450
And now I know

730
00:51:16,294 --> 00:51:22,930
The key to our heaven is mine

731
00:51:24,157 --> 00:51:25,346
My heart has wings

732
00:51:27,993 --> 00:51:30,026
And I can fly

733
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,821
I'll touch every star

734
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,736
In the sky

735
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:43,605
So this is the miracle

736
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:50,510
That I've been dreaming of

737
00:51:58,834 --> 00:52:08,807
So this is love

738
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:11,607
Oh! Oh, my goodness!

739
00:52:12,221 --> 00:52:13,449
What's the matter?

740
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:14,446
It's midnight.

741
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:17,745
- Yes, so it is, but--
- Goodbye.

742
00:52:18,397 --> 00:52:19,471
No, no, wait. You can't go now. It's only--

743
00:52:20,852 --> 00:52:22,770
Oh, I must, please. Please, I must.

744
00:52:23,115 --> 00:52:24,266
- But why?
- Well, I...I...

745
00:52:24,956 --> 00:52:27,181
Oh, the Prince. I haven't met the Prince.

746
00:52:27,565 --> 00:52:29,559
The Prince? But didn't you know--

747
00:52:30,135 --> 00:52:33,740
- Goodbye!
- No, wait. Come back.

748
00:52:34,393 --> 00:52:35,121
Please come back!

749
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:37,845
I don't even know your name.
How will I find you?

750
00:52:38,305 --> 00:52:39,341
Wait! Please wait!

751
00:52:40,722 --> 00:52:41,527
Goodbye.

752
00:52:43,254 --> 00:52:44,366
I say, young Iady!

753
00:52:44,443 --> 00:52:45,900
- Who is she?
- Wait!

754
00:52:46,284 --> 00:52:47,665
- Who is she?
- Isn't she IoveIy?

755
00:52:52,076 --> 00:52:53,227
Mademoiselle!

756
00:52:53,802 --> 00:52:55,260
See rita!

757
00:52:57,331 --> 00:52:59,096
Just a moment!

758
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:00,937
Stop! Stop!

759
00:53:03,123 --> 00:53:06,115
Stop that coach! Close those gates!

760
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:10,450
Follow that coach!

761
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:12,598
Open the gates!

762
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:49,768
I'm sorry.

763
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,412
I... I guess I forgot about everything,

764
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:55,982
even the time, but...

765
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,856
but it was so wonderful.

766
00:54:01,544 --> 00:54:02,772
And he was so handsome,

767
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:04,421
and when we danced--

768
00:54:05,265 --> 00:54:07,567
Oh, I’m sure that even the Prince himself...

769
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,791
couldn't have been more... more--

770
00:54:11,901 --> 00:54:13,781
Oh, well. It's over and--

771
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:14,970
Cinderelly! Look, look!

772
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:17,118
- A slipper, a slipper!
- Yeah, a slipper.

773
00:54:17,578 --> 00:54:19,036
- Your slipper, Cinderelly.
- Yeah, your slipper.

774
00:54:19,765 --> 00:54:20,609
Oh!

775
00:54:23,601 --> 00:54:24,521
Thank you.

776
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:28,280
Thank you so much, for everything.

777
00:54:38,868 --> 00:54:42,243
Your Majesty, I see no point
in beating about the bush.

778
00:54:42,972 --> 00:54:44,391
I regret to inform you, Sire,

779
00:54:44,967 --> 00:54:46,501
that the young Iady has disappeared...

780
00:54:47,115 --> 00:54:48,841
Ieaving behind only this glass slipper.

781
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,334
Yes, I'll do it.

782
00:54:53,904 --> 00:54:56,359
No, I just can't.

783
00:55:22,942 --> 00:55:25,397
Well? Come in.

784
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:27,584
Come in!

785
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:30,691
- Your Majesty--
- So... he's proposed already!

786
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:32,148
- Tell me all about it.- Well, Sire--

787
00:55:32,148 --> 00:55:33,529
Who is she?
Where does she Iive?

788
00:55:33,606 --> 00:55:35,524
- Well, I didn't get a chance--- No matter.

789
00:55:35,907 --> 00:55:37,250
We've more important things to discuss.

790
00:55:37,442 --> 00:55:41,086
Arrangements for the wedding,
invitations, a national holiday.

791
00:55:42,582 --> 00:55:43,809
- All that sort of thing.
- But, but, Sire--

792
00:55:44,423 --> 00:55:46,533
Here, here, have a cigar. Take a few more.

793
00:55:47,032 --> 00:55:47,875
ha...

794
00:55:47,914 --> 00:55:48,719
But, but, but--

795
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:50,637
Better practice passing these out, eh?

796
00:55:50,983 --> 00:55:54,550
But, but, but, if you'd... only listen!

797
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,161
And for you, my friend...

798
00:55:56,736 --> 00:55:57,849
Your, Your Majesty, p-p-please.

799
00:55:58,347 --> 00:55:59,191
a knighthood!

800
00:56:00,304 --> 00:56:01,646
I hereby dub you Sir...

801
00:56:02,452 --> 00:56:03,257
Uh... um...

802
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:06,019
By the way, what title would you like?

803
00:56:06,748 --> 00:56:09,203
- Sire, she got away, sir.
- She got away?

804
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:11,927
A peculiar title, but if that’s what you--

805
00:56:12,732 --> 00:56:14,075
She what?

806
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:17,374
Why you, you... you traitor!

807
00:56:17,604 --> 00:56:20,212
Now, Sire, remember your...
your blood pressure.

808
00:56:20,749 --> 00:56:23,281
Traitor!

809
00:56:25,045 --> 00:56:25,736
No, Sire, no!

810
00:56:27,002 --> 00:56:28,076
Sabotage!

811
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:31,375
You were in Ieague with the Prince all along!

812
00:56:32,027 --> 00:56:32,947
I tried to stop her...

813
00:56:33,216 --> 00:56:35,479
but she vanished into thin air!

814
00:56:35,709 --> 00:56:38,164
- A IikeIy story!
- But it’s true, Sire!

815
00:56:38,778 --> 00:56:40,657
All we could find was this glass slipper.

816
00:56:41,194 --> 00:56:42,921
The whole thing was a plot!

817
00:56:43,995 --> 00:56:45,874
But, Sire, he Ioves her.

818
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,368
He won't rest 'tiI he finds her.

819
00:56:48,943 --> 00:56:50,055
He's determined to marry her.

820
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:54,160
What? What did you say?

821
00:56:55,004 --> 00:56:58,264
The Prince, Sire, swears
he'll marry none but the girl...

822
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,295
- who fits this slipper.
- He said that, did he?

823
00:57:02,407 --> 00:57:04,709
Ha-ha! We've got him!

824
00:57:05,284 --> 00:57:06,550
Yahoo-o-o!

825
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:13,032
But, Sire, this slipper
may fit any number of girls.

826
00:57:13,339 --> 00:57:15,603
That's his problem. He's given his word.

827
00:57:16,024 --> 00:57:18,019
- We'll hold him to it.
- No, no, Your Highness.

828
00:57:19,093 --> 00:57:20,512
I'll have nothing to do with it.

829
00:57:20,973 --> 00:57:23,006
You'll try this on every maid in my kingdom,

830
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:24,962
and if the shoe fits...

831
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,455
bring her in!

832
00:57:27,724 --> 00:57:30,716
Y-y-yes, Your Majesty.

833
00:57:43,796 --> 00:57:45,945
Cinderella! Cinderella?

834
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,284
Cinderella!

835
00:57:48,284 --> 00:57:49,742
- Oh, where is that--
- Yes? Here I am.

836
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,427
Oh... my daughters, where are they?

837
00:57:52,772 --> 00:57:54,268
I... I think they're still in bed.

838
00:57:54,575 --> 00:57:56,992
Oh... Well, don't just stand there.

839
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,946
Bring up the breakfast
trays at once, and hurry!

840
00:58:01,595 --> 00:58:03,014
Uh-oh! Wonder what's the matter.

841
00:58:03,206 --> 00:58:04,894
Duh... duh... What's the matter with her?

842
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:06,045
I don’t know. Let's find out.

843
00:58:06,313 --> 00:58:07,195
Come on!

844
00:58:15,212 --> 00:58:16,939
Drizella! Drizella!

845
00:58:17,591 --> 00:58:18,780
What?

846
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,081
Get up! Quick! This instant!

847
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:22,654
We haven't a moment to Iose.

848
00:58:24,495 --> 00:58:26,874
Anastasia? Anastasia.

849
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:31,131
Get up, Anastasia!

850
00:58:32,397 --> 00:58:33,932
What for? Why?

851
00:58:34,354 --> 00:58:37,921
Oh, everyone's talking about it
the whole kingdom. Hurry now!

852
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:39,609
- He'll be here any minute.
- Who will?

853
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:42,601
The Grand Duke. He's been hunting all night.

854
00:58:42,869 --> 00:58:44,289
- Hunting?
- For that girl.

855
00:58:44,941 --> 00:58:46,859
The one who Iost her slipper
at the ball Iast night.

856
00:58:47,434 --> 00:58:49,083
They say he's madly in love with her.

857
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:52,306
- The Duke is?
- No, no, no! The Prince!

858
00:58:53,188 --> 00:58:55,221
The Prince!

859
00:58:56,755 --> 00:58:58,098
You clumsy little fool!

860
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:01,473
Clean that up, and then
help my daughters dress.

861
00:59:01,665 --> 00:59:02,778
What for?

862
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:07,074
If he’s in Iove with that girl,
why should we even bother?

863
00:59:07,457 --> 00:59:08,800
Now, you two, Iisten to me!

864
00:59:10,027 --> 00:59:12,252
There is still a chance
that one of you can get him.

865
00:59:13,096 --> 00:59:14,209
What? One of us?

866
00:59:15,283 --> 00:59:16,357
Why, Mother, what do you mean?

867
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:19,732
Just this. No one, not even the Prince,

868
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:21,689
knows who that girl is.

869
00:59:21,842 --> 00:59:23,031
We do! We do! Cinderelly, Cinder--

870
00:59:23,913 --> 00:59:25,946
The glass slipper is their only clue.

871
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:30,204
The Duke has been ordered to try it
on every girl in the kingdom,

872
00:59:30,665 --> 00:59:33,695
and if one can be found
whom the slipper fits, then...

873
00:59:34,424 --> 00:59:38,183
by the King's command, that girl
shall be the Prince's bride.

874
00:59:39,257 --> 00:59:41,290
Bride... Bride!

875
00:59:41,597 --> 00:59:43,055
Cinderella, get my things together.

876
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,011
Never mind her, mend these right away!

877
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:46,775
Not until she irons my dress!

878
00:59:47,274 --> 00:59:49,154
- Mend these.
- After she's brushed my shoes.

879
00:59:49,959 --> 00:59:51,072
But first get my new--

880
00:59:51,647 --> 00:59:54,677
W-w-what's the matter with her?

881
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:57,900
- Wake up, stupid!
- We've gotta get dressed!

882
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:00,930
Dressed... Oh, yes...

883
01:00:01,812 --> 01:00:04,421
We must get dressed. It would never do...

884
01:00:04,996 --> 01:00:05,763
for the Duke to see me looking like this.

885
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,298
Mother, did you see what she did?

886
01:00:07,489 --> 01:00:09,024
- Are you just going to Iet--
- Quiet!

887
01:00:11,555 --> 01:00:13,397
So this is love

888
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:29,392
- What she gonna do?
- Shhh! I don't know.

889
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:30,965
Gotta watch her. Come on!

890
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:52,791
Ia, Ia...

891
01:00:53,137 --> 01:00:55,783
- Cinderelly, Cinderelly!
- Cinderelly!

892
01:00:56,742 --> 01:00:59,121
- Look out, Iook out!
- So this is the miracle

893
01:01:00,463 --> 01:01:01,537
That I've been dreaming of

894
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:04,222
- Cinderelly, look out!
- Behind you, behind you!

895
01:01:04,606 --> 01:01:05,757
- Look behind you, Cinderelly!
- What?

896
01:01:09,286 --> 01:01:10,475
Oh! Oh, no!

897
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:12,278
No, please!

898
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,155
Oh, you can’t! You just can't!

899
01:01:15,615 --> 01:01:16,344
Let me out! You must Iet me out!

900
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,453
oh... ho...

901
01:01:18,569 --> 01:01:20,026
You can't keep me in here!

902
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:22,903
Please...

903
01:01:23,709 --> 01:01:25,435
No, no! She can't do it!

904
01:01:25,703 --> 01:01:27,353
She can't Iock up Cinderelly! I'm gonna--

905
01:01:28,427 --> 01:01:29,654
Oh, please, please.

906
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,797
We gotta get that key, Gus-Gus.
We just gotta get that key.

907
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:40,280
Whoa!

908
01:01:46,149 --> 01:01:47,721
He's-a here, he's-a here! A Duke-Duke!

909
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:50,752
- Duh... duh... a who?
- A Grand Duke with the slipper.

910
01:01:51,135 --> 01:01:53,705
- Gotta get that key quick!
- Zuk-zuk key-key quick-quick.

911
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:58,002
Oh, Mother, Mother. He's here!

912
01:01:58,347 --> 01:01:59,574
- He's here!
- The Grand Duke!

913
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:02,068
Do I Iook all right? I'm so excited, I just--

914
01:02:02,413 --> 01:02:04,599
Girls, now remember...

915
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,978
this is your Iast chance. Don't fail me.

916
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:14,880
Announcing His Imperial
Grace, the Grand Duke.

917
01:02:16,414 --> 01:02:17,833
You honour our humble home, m'Lord.

918
01:02:18,332 --> 01:02:19,137
Ahem. Quite so.

919
01:02:20,212 --> 01:02:21,631
May I present my daughters,

920
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,891
Drizella and Anastasia.

921
01:02:25,352 --> 01:02:26,080
Your Grace.

922
01:02:28,459 --> 01:02:29,840
Ladies, charmed I'm sure.

923
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,908
His Grace will read a royal proclamation.

924
01:02:36,322 --> 01:02:39,199
All IoyaI subjects of His
Imperial Majesty are hereby...

925
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:41,424
notified by royal proclamation
in regard to a certain...

926
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:47,945
glass... slipper.
It is upon this day decreed--

927
01:02:48,252 --> 01:02:49,863
Why, that's my slipper!

928
01:02:50,937 --> 01:02:53,162
Well, I like that! It... it's my slipper!

929
01:02:53,699 --> 01:02:56,077
No, No! Cinderelly's
slipper! Cinderelly's slip--

930
01:02:56,307 --> 01:02:59,108
- How can she--- Girls, girls, girls!

931
01:03:00,105 --> 01:03:01,256
Your manners.

932
01:03:02,675 --> 01:03:04,286
A thousand pardons, Your Grace.

933
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:05,514
Please continue.

934
01:03:06,281 --> 01:03:07,163
Yes, quite so.

935
01:03:09,618 --> 01:03:11,574
It is upon this day decreed
that a quest be instituted...

936
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:13,415
throughout the Iength
and breadth of our domain...

937
01:03:14,221 --> 01:03:16,906
the sole and express purpose
of said quest to be as follows:

938
01:03:19,399 --> 01:03:21,164
That every single maiden
in our beloved kingdom,

939
01:03:21,356 --> 01:03:23,274
without prearranged exception,
shall try upon her foot...

940
01:03:23,696 --> 01:03:24,846
this aforementioned slipper of glass.

941
01:03:25,038 --> 01:03:26,534
And should one be found upon whose foot said
slipper...

942
01:03:26,688 --> 01:03:28,069
shall properly fit...

943
01:03:31,905 --> 01:03:34,283
such maiden shall be acclaimed
the object of this search...

944
01:03:34,628 --> 01:03:35,817
and immediately forthwith
shall be looked upon...

945
01:03:36,086 --> 01:03:37,275
as the one and only true love
of His Royal Highness,

946
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:39,039
our beloved son and heir,

947
01:03:40,459 --> 01:03:41,686
the Noble Prince.

948
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,256
Said Noble Prince will humbly
and upon bended knee...

949
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:46,021
beg, request, or if need be, implore...

950
01:03:47,018 --> 01:03:49,588
said maiden, that they
grant her hand in marriage.

951
01:03:51,122 --> 01:03:52,120
Well...Whereupon,

952
01:03:52,312 --> 01:03:53,961
should the aforementioned maide
look with favour upon his suit,

953
01:03:54,306 --> 01:03:55,419
then shall the happy couple
pledge their troth...

954
01:03:56,493 --> 01:03:57,452
on... uh...

955
01:03:58,296 --> 01:04:01,134
And in due course,
upon the inevitable demise...

956
01:04:01,709 --> 01:04:02,707
of His Most Gracious
and August Majesty, the King,

957
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:04,817
succeed to the throne,
there to rule over all the land...

958
01:04:05,047 --> 01:04:06,274
as Kingsland Queen of our beloved kingdom.

959
01:04:06,773 --> 01:04:08,729
Oh... So be it.

960
01:04:11,529 --> 01:04:13,639
You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace.

961
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:15,289
May we offer you some tea?

962
01:04:15,826 --> 01:04:17,590
What? Tea?

963
01:04:19,048 --> 01:04:20,160
Thank you, madam, no.

964
01:04:21,464 --> 01:04:23,382
We must proceed with the... the fitting.

965
01:04:23,766 --> 01:04:26,144
Of course. Anastasia, dear.

966
01:04:29,673 --> 01:04:32,320
There! I knew it was my slipper.

967
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:34,200
Exactly my size.

968
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,539
I always wear the same size.

969
01:04:36,885 --> 01:04:38,304
As soon as I saw it, I said--

970
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:42,447
Oh! Well... it... it may be
a trifle snug today.

971
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,787
You know how it is... dancing all night.

972
01:04:45,861 --> 01:04:46,666
I can't understand why.

973
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,121
It's always fit perfectly before.

974
01:04:50,272 --> 01:04:51,768
I don’t think you're half trying!

975
01:04:52,152 --> 01:04:54,415
- Mother, can you--
- Shhh. Be quiet, my dear.

976
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,944
We mustn't disturb His Grace.

977
01:04:58,596 --> 01:05:01,319
Young man, are you sure you're
trying it on the right foot?

978
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:06,690
Oh, it's the right foot, but
it must have shrunk or something.

979
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:09,298
A glass shoe isn't always reliable.

980
01:05:09,835 --> 01:05:11,254
Come on, Gus-Gus. Hurry! Up the stairs!

981
01:05:11,715 --> 01:05:13,057
Up the stairs!

982
01:05:47,465 --> 01:05:49,230
Why can't you hold still a minute?

983
01:05:49,728 --> 01:05:51,033
Oh, my word!

984
01:05:51,646 --> 01:05:52,375
Enough of this!

985
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:56,556
The next young Iady, please.

986
01:05:57,439 --> 01:05:58,513
Hear that, Gus? Hear that?

987
01:05:58,858 --> 01:06:00,469
- Yup.
- Quick. Gotta hurry!

988
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:08,026
Come on, come on! Hurry!

989
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:20,147
. Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus. Aw, come on.
Look, Look. It's just up there

990
01:06:20,492 --> 01:06:21,528
Come on!

991
01:06:29,967 --> 01:06:30,734
Us a-comin', Cinderelly.

992
01:06:30,926 --> 01:06:32,614
Us a-comin'! Us'll get you out.

993
01:06:32,844 --> 01:06:36,258
You've got the key.
How did you ever manage it?

994
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:40,938
Lucifer! Let him go, Lucifer!

995
01:06:41,782 --> 01:06:43,124
Please, let him go!

996
01:06:44,198 --> 01:06:46,423
- Let him go.
- Let him go! Let him out!

997
01:06:46,768 --> 01:06:49,223
Let him out! Here! Here, R-ucifee!

998
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:27,697
Bruno!

999
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:29,424
Yes! Bruno!

1000
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,339
Quick! Get Bruno! Get Bruno!

1001
01:07:52,516 --> 01:07:55,393
Oh, of all the stupid little idiots!

1002
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:57,464
I'll do it myself!

1003
01:07:58,576 --> 01:07:59,497
Get away from me!

1004
01:07:59,919 --> 01:08:01,262
I'll make it fit!

1005
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:04,484
There!

1006
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:05,903
- It fit!
- It fits?

1007
01:08:14,994 --> 01:08:18,792
Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.

1008
01:08:19,482 --> 01:08:20,594
It shan't happen again.

1009
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,784
Precisely, madam.

1010
01:08:47,561 --> 01:08:49,517
Come on, come on! Get up, Gus-Gus!

1011
01:08:49,824 --> 01:08:50,515
Get up, get up!

1012
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,164
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

1013
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:54,197
Let go, let go!

1014
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:02,751
You are the only ladies
of the household, I hope-- I presume.

1015
01:09:02,981 --> 01:09:03,902
There’s no one else, Your Grace.

1016
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,743
Quite so. Good day.

1017
01:09:06,127 --> 01:09:07,392
- Good day!
- Your Grace!

1018
01:09:08,198 --> 01:09:09,464
Your Grace!

1019
01:09:09,541 --> 01:09:12,149
Please! Wait! May I try it on?

1020
01:09:12,686 --> 01:09:14,067
Oh, pay no attention to her.

1021
01:09:14,374 --> 01:09:16,330
- It's only Cinderella.- Our scullery maid.

1022
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:17,749
- From the kitchen.
- It's ridiculous.

1023
01:09:17,788 --> 01:09:18,823
- Impossible.
- She’s out of her mind.

1024
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,163
Yes, yes. Just an imaginative child.

1025
01:09:21,662 --> 01:09:24,386
Madam, my orders were every maiden!

1026
01:09:26,035 --> 01:09:26,841
Come, my child.

1027
01:09:42,069 --> 01:09:45,176
Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no!

1028
01:09:45,368 --> 01:09:48,628
Oh, no! This is terrible. The King!

1029
01:09:49,281 --> 01:09:50,048
What will he say?

1030
01:09:51,045 --> 01:09:52,157
What will he do?

1031
01:09:52,694 --> 01:09:54,114
But perhaps, if it would help--

1032
01:09:54,574 --> 01:09:57,528
No, no. Nothing can help now, nothing.

1033
01:09:57,681 --> 01:09:59,446
But, you see, I have the other slipper.

1034
01:10:36,385 --> 01:10:40,528
Have faith in dreams and someday

1035
01:10:41,449 --> 01:10:46,781
Your rainbow will come smiling through

1036
01:10:47,126 --> 01:10:51,039
No matter how your heart is grieving

1037
01:10:51,576 --> 01:10:54,759
If you keep on believing

1038
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:01,971
The dreams that you wish
will come true.
