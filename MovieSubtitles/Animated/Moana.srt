1
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,678
In the beginning...

2
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,673
there was only ocean...

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,799
until the mother island emerged.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,797
Te Fiti.

5
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,194
Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.

6
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,318
It could create life itself.

7
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,712
And Te Fiti shared it with the world.

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,354
But in time...

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,552
some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

10
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,836
They believed
if they could possess it...

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,629
the great power of creation
would be theirs.

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,155
And one day...

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,314
the most daring of them all...

14
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,837
voyaged across the vast ocean
to take it.

15
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,029
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.

16
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,072
He was a warrior.

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,553
A trickster.

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,235
A shapeshifter who
could change form...

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,033
with the power of his magical fish hook.

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,359
And his name...

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,395
was Maui.

22
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,396
But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble...

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,313
giving birth to a terrible darkness.

24
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,352
Maui tried to escape...

25
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,912
but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.

26
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,432
Te Kā!

27
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,592
A demon of earth and fire.

28
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,118
Maui was struck from the sky...

29
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,669
never to be seen again.

30
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,956
And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,918
were lost to the sea.

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,238
Where, even now...

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,356
1,000 years later...

34
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,114
Te Kā and the demons of the deep...

35
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,271
still hunt for the heart.

36
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,793
Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...

37
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,235
chasing away our fish...

38
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,637
draining the life
from island after island...

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,031
until every one of us is devoured...

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,879
by the bloodthirsty jaws...

41
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,793
of inescapable death!

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,638
But one day...

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,791
the heart will be found...

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,072
by someone who will journey
beyond our reef...

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,559
find Maui...

46
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,836
deliver him across the great ocean...

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,150
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

48
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,992
and save us all.

49
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,776
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Thank you, Mother. That's enough.

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Papa.

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,671
No one goes outside the reef.

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,912
We are safe here. There is no darkness.

53
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,832
There are no monsters.

54
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Monsters!

55
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,241
- There's no monsters, no monsters...
- It's the darkness!

56
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,195
No, there is nothing beyond our reef,
but storms and rough seas.

57
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,475
I'm gonna throw up.

58
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,790
As long as we stay
on our very safe island...

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,794
...we'll be fine.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,433
The legends are true.

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,192
Someone will have to go.

62
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,516
Mother, Motunui is paradise.

63
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,360
Who would want to go anywhere else?

64
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,716
Shoo, shoo!

65
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,714
Moana!

66
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,838
There you are, Moana.
What are you doing? You scared me.

67
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,632
What? I wanna's go back.

68
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,394
I know, I know.
But you don't go out there.

69
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,514
It's dangerous.

70
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,510
Moana, come on.

71
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,711
Let's go back to the village.

72
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,755
You are the next great chief
of our people.

73
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,912
And you will do wondrous things,
my little minnow.

74
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,479
Oh, yes. But first, you must learn
where you're meant to be.

75
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,312
Moana

76
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,835
Make way, make way

77
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,917
Moana, it's time you knew

78
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,834
The village of Motunui is all you need

79
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,070
The dancers are practicing

80
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,555
They dance to an ancient song

81
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,558
Who needs a new song
This old one's all we need

82
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,671
This tradition is our mission

83
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,394
And Moana, there's so much to do

84
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,953
Don't trip on the taro root

85
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,236
That's all you need

86
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,396
We share everything we make

87
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,437
We joke and we weave our baskets

88
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,875
The fishermen come back from the sea

89
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,553
I wanna see

90
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,472
Don't walk away

91
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,551
Moana, stay on the ground now

92
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,597
Our people will need a chief

93
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,671
- And there you are
- There you are

94
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,717
There comes a day

95
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,589
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is

96
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,591
Where you are

97
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,359
Consider the coconut

98
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,755
- The what
- Consider its tree

99
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,276
We use each part of the coconut
It's all we need

100
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,916
We make our nets from the fibers

101
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,911
The water is sweet inside

102
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,198
We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside

103
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,112
Consider the coconuts

104
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,032
The trunks and the leaves

105
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,714
The island gives us what we need

106
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,632
And no one leaves

107
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,279
That's right, we stay

108
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,032
We're safe and we're well-provided

109
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,151
And when we look to the future

110
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,799
There you are

111
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,635
You'll be okay

112
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,597
In time you'll learn just as I did

113
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,469
You must find happiness
right where you are

114
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,998
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves

115
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,153
The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves

116
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,233
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far

117
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,911
But once you know what you like
Well, there you are

118
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,958
You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride

119
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,438
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside

120
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,752
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star

121
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,430
Moana, that voice inside
is who you are

122
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,516
- Uh-huh.
- Dad!

123
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,156
I was only looking at the boats.
I wasn't gonna get on 'em.

124
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,475
Come on.
There's something I need to show you.

125
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,029
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

126
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,710
This is a sacred place.

127
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,871
A place of chiefs.

128
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,553
There will come a time...

129
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,669
when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.

130
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,400
Like I did. Like my father did.

131
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,553
And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.

132
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,718
And on that day...

133
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,150
when you add your stone...

134
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,869
you will raise this whole island higher.

135
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,839
You are the future of our people, Moana.

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,560
And they are not out there.

137
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,598
They are right here.

138
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,911
It's time to be who they need you to be.

139
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,576
- We make our nets from the fibers
- We weave our nets from the fibers

140
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,760
- The water is sweet inside
- A real tasty treat inside

141
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,056
- We use the leaves to build fires
- We sing these songs in our choirs

142
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,056
- To cook up the meat inside
- We have mouths to feed inside

143
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,911
- The village believes in us
- That's right

144
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,599
The village believes

145
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,910
The island gives us what we need

146
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,111
And no one leaves

147
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,599
So here I'll stay

148
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,589
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow

149
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,830
There we are

150
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,798
I'll lead the way

151
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,951
I'll have my people to guide me

152
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,758
We'll build our future together

153
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,956
Where we are

154
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,838
'Cause every path leads ya back to

155
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,434
Where you are

156
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,917
You can find happiness right

157
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,958
Where you are

158
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,113
Where you are

159
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,469
And every storm, th is roof leaks,
no matter how many fronds I add.

160
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Fixed!

161
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,915
Not the fronds.

162
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,236
- Wind shifted the post.
- Ah!

163
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,353
Mmm! That's good pork!

164
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,471
Oh! I didn't mean... I wasn't...

165
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,633
What?
They're calling me, so I gotta... Bye!

166
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,313
Ow! Ow! Ow!

167
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,674
You're doing great.

168
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,239
Is it done yet?

169
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,752
So close.

170
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,550
I'm curious about that chicken
eating the rock.

171
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,629
He seems to lack the basic intelligence
required for pretty much everything.

172
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,712
Should we maybe just cook him?

173
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,111
Sometimes our strengths lie
beneath the surface.

174
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,995
Far beneath in some cases.

175
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,355
But I'm sure there's more to Heihei

176
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,960
than meets the eye.

177
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,749
It's the harvest.

178
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,317
This morning,
I was husking the coconuts and...

179
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,115
Well...

180
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,155
we should clear the diseased trees
and we will start a new grove.

181
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,240
There.

182
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,034
Thanks, Moana.

183
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,191
She's doing great.

184
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,554
This suits you.

185
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
Chief?

186
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,595
There's something you need to see.

187
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,598
Our traps in the east lagoon...

188
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,911
they're pulling up less and less fish.

189
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,755
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

190
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,076
Uh, we have. There's no fish.

191
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,431
Oh. Then we'll fish
the far side of the island.

192
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,635
We tried.

193
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,074
The windward side.

194
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,755
And the leeward side, the shallows,
the channel.

195
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,593
We've tried the whole lagoon.

196
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,110
They're just gone.

197
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,397
Have you tried using a different bait?

198
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,120
I don't think it's the bait.

199
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,594
There's no fish.

200
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,576
It seems like
it's getting worse and worse.

201
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,592
Of course, I understand
you have reason for concern.

202
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,976
I will talk to the council.
I'm sure we...

203
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,833
What if we fish beyond the reef?

204
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,111
No one goes beyond the reef.

205
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,748
I know. But if there are no fish
in the lagoon...

206
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,838
- Moana.
- And there's a whole ocean.

207
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,633
We have one rule.

208
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,320
An old rule, when there were fish.

209
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,176
- A rule that keeps us safe...
- But Dad, I...

210
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,159
...instead of endangering our people
so you can run right back to the water.

211
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,354
Every time I think you're past this...

212
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,270
No one goes beyond the reef!

213
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,992
Well, it's not like you said it
in front of your dad.

214
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,159
Standing on a boat.

215
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,152
I didn't say go beyond the reef,
because I want to be on the ocean.

216
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,311
But you still do.

217
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,194
- He's hard on you because...
- Because he doesn't get me.

218
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,960
Because he was you.

219
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,637
Drawn to the ocean.

220
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,153
Down by the shore.

221
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,952
He took a canoe, Moana.

222
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,588
He crossed the reef...

223
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,835
and found an unforgiving sea.

224
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,072
Waves like mountains.

225
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,351
His best friend begged
to be on that boat.

226
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,110
Your dad couldn't save him.

227
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,516
He's hoping he can save you.

228
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,359
Sometimes...

229
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,433
who we wish we were,
what we wish we could do...

230
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,236
it's just not meant to be.

231
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,392
I've been staring
at the edge of the water

232
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,711
Long as I can remember

233
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,833
Never really knowing why

234
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,552
I wish I could be the perfect daughter

235
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,558
But I come back to the water

236
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,955
No matter how hard I try

237
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,991
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

238
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,034
Every path I make
Every road leads back

239
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,749
To the place I know
Where I cannot go

240
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,354
Where I long to be

241
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,988
See the line where the
sky meets the sea

242
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,436
It calls me

243
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,433
And no one knows

244
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,434
How far it goes

245
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,715
If the wind in my sail on the sea
Stays behind me

246
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,435
One day I'll know

247
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,832
If I go, there's just no telling
how far I'll go

248
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,038
I know everybody on this island

249
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,794
Seems so happy on this island

250
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,520
Everything is by design

251
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,990
I know everybody on this island

252
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,233
Has a role on this island

253
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,955
So maybe I can roll with mine

254
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,198
I can lead with pride
I can make us strong

255
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,875
I'll be satisfied
If I play along

256
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,311
But the voice inside
Sings a different song

257
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,352
What is wrong with me

258
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,114
See the light as it shines on the sea

259
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,999
It's blinding

260
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,197
But no one knows

261
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,837
How deep it goes

262
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,070
And it seems like it's calling out to me

263
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,040
So come find me

264
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,749
And let me know

265
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,392
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line

266
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,591
The line where the sky meets the sea

267
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,520
It calls me

268
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,319
And no one knows

269
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,790
How far it goes

270
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,676
If the wind in my sail on the sea
stays behind me

271
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,519
One day I'll know

272
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,993
How far I'll go

273
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Whoa.

274
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,875
We're okay, Pua.

275
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,588
I can do this.

276
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,873
There's more fish beyond the reef.

277
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,795
There's more beyond the reef.

278
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,679
Not so bad.

279
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,430
Pua!

280
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,793
Whatever just happened...

281
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,279
blame it on the pig.

282
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,675
Gramma.

283
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,118
Are you gonna tell Dad?

284
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,711
I'm his mom.
I don't have to tell him anything.

285
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,714
He was right.

286
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,471
About going out there.

287
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,992
It's time to put my stone
on the mountain.

288
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,152
Okay. Well, then, head on back.

289
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,672
Put that stone up there.

290
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,272
Why aren't you trying
to talk me out of it?

291
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,115
You said that's what you wanted.

292
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
It is.

293
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,831
When I die...

294
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,517
I'm going to come back as one of these.

295
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,798
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

296
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,632
Why are you acting weird?

297
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,316
I'm the village crazy lady.
That's my job.

298
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,629
If there's something you want to tell me,
just tell me!

299
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,637
Is there something you wanna tell me?

300
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,032
Is there something you want to hear?

301
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,872
You've been told
all our people's stories...

302
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,392
but one.

303
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,833
What is this place?

304
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,478
Do you really think
our ancestors stayed within the reef?

305
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,391
Ooh!

306
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,798
What's in there?

307
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,471
The answer to the question
you keep asking yourself.

308
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,639
Who are you meant to be?

309
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,672
Go inside...

310
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,398
bang the drum...

311
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,876
and find out.

312
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Whoa.

313
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
Oh.

314
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,993
Bang the drum.

315
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,638
We read the wind and the sky

316
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,638
When the sun is high

317
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,598
We sail the length of the seas

318
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,439
On the ocean breeze

319
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,115
At night we name every star

320
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,436
We know where we are

321
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,799
We know who we are
Who we are

322
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,756
We set a course to find

323
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,478
A brand new island
everywhere we roam

324
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,237
We keep our island in our mind

325
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,394
And when it's time to find home

326
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,437
We know the way

327
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,430
We are explorers reading every sign

328
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,630
We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain

329
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,838
We know the way

330
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,437
We were voyagers.

331
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,674
We were voyagers!

332
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,709
We were voyagers! We were voyagers!

333
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,638
We were voyagers!

334
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,593
Why'd we stop?

335
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,795
Maui.

336
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,995
When he stole from the mother island,
darkness fell.

337
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,472
Te Kā awoke.

338
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,391
Monsters lurked
and boats stopped coming back.

339
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,835
To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...

340
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,833
and now we have forgotten who we are.

341
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,914
And the darkness
has continued to spread...

342
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,192
chasing away our fish...

343
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,118
draining the life...

344
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,876
from island after island.

345
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,111
Our island.

346
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,551
But, one day...

347
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,838
someone will journey beyond our reef,
find Maui...

348
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,912
deliver him across the great ocean...

349
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,435
to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

350
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,192
I was there that day.

351
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,198
The ocean chose you.

352
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,110
I thought it was a dream.

353
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,752
Nope!

354
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,434
Our ancestors
believed Maui lies there...

355
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,352
at the bottom of his hook.

356
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,638
Follow it, and you will find him.

357
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,236
But why would it choose me?

358
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,472
I don't even know
how to make it past the reef.

359
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,236
But I know who does!

360
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,160
The crops
are turning black.

361
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,736
What about the fish?

362
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,416
This is happening all over the island.

363
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,056
- Please, please settle down.
- What are you going to do?

364
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,856
We will dig new fields.
We will find a way to...

365
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,394
We can stop the darkness!
Save our island!

366
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,113
There's a cavern of boats.

367
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,799
Huge canoes.

368
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,549
We can take them, find Maui,
make him restore the heart.

369
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,191
We were voyagers.
We can voyage again!

370
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,032
You told me to help our people.

371
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,430
This is how we help our people.

372
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,869
Dad?

373
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
What are you doing?

374
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,629
I should've burned those boats
a long time ago!

375
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,835
No! Don't!

376
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,560
We have to find Maui.
We have to restore the heart!

377
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,029
There is no heart!

378
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,872
This is just a rock!

379
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
No!

380
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,470
Chief! It's your mother!

381
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,154
Mother...

382
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,793
What can be done?

383
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,109
Go.

384
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,999
Gramma.

385
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,715
Go.

386
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,714
Not now. I can't.

387
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,189
You must!

388
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,751
The ocean chose you.

389
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,388
Follow the fish hook.

390
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Gramma...

391
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,830
And when you find Maui...

392
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,829
you grab him by the ear. You say...

393
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,232
"I am Moana of Motunui.

394
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,836
"You will board my boat...

395
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,390
"sail across the sea...

396
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,553
"and restore the heart of Te Fiti."

397
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,715
I can't leave you.

398
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,399
There is nowhere you could go
that I won't be with you.

399
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,759
Go!

400
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,393
There's a line
where the sky meets the sea

401
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,398
And it calls me

402
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,469
But no one knows

403
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,315
How far it goes

404
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,436
All that time wondering where I need
to be is behind me

405
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,553
I'm on my own

406
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,589
To worlds unknown

407
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,833
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

408
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,718
Is a choice I make

409
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,473
Now I can't turn back
from the great unknown

410
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,037
Where I go alone
Where I long to be

411
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,795
See her light up the night in the sea

412
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,634
She calls me

413
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,429
And yes, I know

414
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,075
That I can go

415
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,235
There's a moon in the sky
And the wind is behind me

416
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,796
Soon I'll know

417
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,395
How far I'll go

418
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,711
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat...

419
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,279
sail across the sea
and restore the heart of T e Fiti.

420
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,080
I am Moana...

421
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,800
of Motu...

422
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,235
...nui.

423
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Heihei?

424
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,438
It's okay. You're all right.

425
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,229
See?

426
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,438
There we go. Nice water.

427
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,114
The ocean is a friend of mine.

428
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,435
Heihei?

429
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
Heihei!

430
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
Stay.

431
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,673
Okay. Next stop, Maui.

432
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,360
I am Moana of Motunui.

433
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,678
You will board my boat...

434
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,671
sail... across the sea...

435
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,956
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

436
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,111
I am Moana of Motu...

437
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,519
Board my boat!

438
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,549
Oh, no.

439
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,558
No, no, no!

440
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,995
Ocean...

441
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,079
can I get a little help?

442
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,675
No, no.

443
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
Please.

444
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
Come on!

445
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,279
Help me!

446
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,760
Please!

447
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
Whew!

448
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,755
Um...

449
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,995
What?

450
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,958
I said help me!

451
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,270
And wrecking my boat?

452
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,438
Not helping!

453
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,032
Fish pee in you all day!

454
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,315
So...

455
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Maui?

456
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,828
Maui!

457
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,594
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...

458
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,478
I am Moana of Motunui.

459
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,198
You will board my boat.

460
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,271
No. You will board my boat.

461
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,193
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.

462
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,114
You will board my...

463
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,350
Boat! A boat!

464
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,193
The gods have given me a...

465
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,152
Maui, shapeshifter...

466
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,437
demigod of the wind and sea...

467
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,592
- I am Moana of...
- Hero of men.

468
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,193
What?

469
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,840
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,
demigod of the wind and sea...

470
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,149
hero of men.

471
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,232
I interrupted.
From the top. Hero of men. Go.

472
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I am...

473
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,509
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

474
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,990
And women. Men and women.

475
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
Both. All.

476
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,913
Not a guy, girl thing.

477
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,832
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

478
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,360
You're doing great.

479
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,038
What? No! I'm here to...

480
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,599
Of course.

481
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,909
Yes, yes, yes.

482
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,874
Maui always has time for his fans.

483
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,600
When you use a bird to write with...

484
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,353
it's called tweeting.

485
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,833
I know, not every day
you get a chance to meet your hero.

486
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,832
You are not my hero.

487
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,554
And I'm not here
so you can sign my oar!

488
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,359
I'm here 'cause
you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

489
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,556
And you will board my boat...

490
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,917
and sail across the sea and put it back!

491
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,115
Um...

492
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,953
Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me...

493
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,031
which is impossible because...

494
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,997
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

495
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,390
trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.

496
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,876
So you could have the power
to create life itself.

497
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,430
Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say...

498
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
is "thank you."

499
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,239
- "Thank you?"
- You're welcome.

500
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
What? No, no, no!

501
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,879
I didn't... I wasn't...

502
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,080
Why would I ever say that?

503
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,474
Okay, okay.

504
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,430
I see what's happening
Yeah

505
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,558
You're face to face with greatness
and it's strange

506
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,312
You don't even know how you feel

507
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,113
It's adorable

508
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,153
Well it's nice to see that humans
never change

509
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,551
Open your eyes
Let's begin

510
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,795
Yes, it's really me

511
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,916
It's Maui
Breathe it in

512
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,758
I know it's a lot

513
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,831
The hair
The bod

514
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,755
When you're staring at a demigod

515
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,590
What can I say except

516
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
You're welcome

517
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,273
For the tides, the sun, the sky

518
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,750
Hey, it's okay, it's okay

519
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,592
You're welcome

520
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,638
I'm just an ordinary demiguy
Hey!

521
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,917
What has two thumbs
and pulled up the sky

522
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,917
When you were waddling yay high?

523
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,235
This guy

524
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,712
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?

525
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,117
You're looking at him yo

526
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,955
Oh also I lassoed the sun

527
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
You're welcome

528
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,955
To stretch your days and bring you fun

529
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,918
Also I harnessed the breeze

530
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
You're welcome

531
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,795
To fill your sails and shake your trees

532
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,915
So what can I say except
You're welcome

533
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,548
For the islands I pulled from the sea

534
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,350
There's no need to pray
It's okay

535
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,839
You're welcome

536
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,794
Ha
I guess it's just my way of being me

537
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
You're welcome

538
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,278
You're welcome

539
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,994
Well come to think of it

540
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,232
Kid, honestly I could go on and on

541
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,200
I could explain every
natural phenomenon

542
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,472
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh that was Maui just messing around

543
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,473
I killed an eel
I buried its guts

544
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,040
Sprouted a tree
Now you got coconuts

545
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,080
What's the lesson?
What is the take away?

546
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,040
Don't mess with Maui
when he's on a breakaway

547
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,038
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win

548
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,280
Look where I've been
I make everything happen

549
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,476
Look at that
Mean Mini-Maui just tickety tappin'

550
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,153
Ha ha
Ha ha

551
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,191
Ha ha
Hey

552
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,358
Well anyway let me say
You're welcome

553
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,669
You're welcome

554
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,479
For the wonderful world you know

555
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,518
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome

556
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,715
You're welcome

557
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,514
Well come to think of it
I gotta go

558
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,558
Hey it's your day to say
You're welcome

559
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,869
You're welcome

560
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,508
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat

561
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,793
I'm sailing away away
You're welcome

562
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,915
You're welcome

563
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,310
'Cause Maui can do
everything but float

564
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,712
- You're welcome
- You're welcome

565
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
Huh?

566
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
And thank you!

567
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
Hey!

568
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,716
Let me out! You lying, slimy son of a...

569
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,391
You're welcome

570
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,514
You're so welcome.

571
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,350
No. I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

572
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
I'm going to get my hook.

573
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,711
You have yours and
I'm not Maui without mine.

574
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,114
Okay, talk to the back.

575
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,069
Boat snack.

576
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,709
Good riddance,
you filthy pile of pebbles.

577
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,549
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

578
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,280
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.

579
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,031
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

580
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,596
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

581
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,155
I could watch that all day.

582
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,952
Okay. Enjoy the island.

583
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,469
Maui, out.

584
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,073
No! Stop!

585
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,151
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

586
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,398
Did not see that coming.

587
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,592
I am Moana of Motunui.

588
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,079
This is my canoe...

589
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,838
and you will journey to...

590
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,718
All right, get over it. We gotta move.

591
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,909
And she's back.

592
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,635
I am Moana of Motunui...

593
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,999
It was Moana, right?

594
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,195
Yes.

595
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,870
And you will restore the heart!

596
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,349
All right. I'm out.

597
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,874
Oh, come on!

598
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,552
What is your problem?

599
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,038
Are you afraid of it?

600
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,713
No! No.

601
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,279
I'm not afraid.

602
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,230
Stay out of it
or you're sleeping in my armpit.

603
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
You, stop it.

604
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,233
That is not a heart. It is a curse.

605
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,516
The second I took it,
I got blasted outta the sky...

606
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,874
and I lost my hook.

607
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,189
Get it away from me.

608
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,039
Get this away?

609
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,157
Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay?

610
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,992
Stop that. I will smite you!

611
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,832
You wanna get smote?

612
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Smotten?

613
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,668
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life...

614
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,558
it's a homing beacon of death.

615
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,040
If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

616
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,158
Come for this? The heart?

617
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,456
You mean this heart right here?

618
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,576
Don't, you can't
raise your voice like that!

619
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,033
Come and get it!

620
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,434
You are gonna get us killed!

621
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,117
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti,
so you can put it back.

622
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,280
Thank you.

623
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,589
You're welcome.

624
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,589
Kakamora.

625
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,034
Kaka-what?

626
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,599
Murdering little pirates.

627
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,199
Wonder what they're here for.

628
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,915
They're kinda cute.

629
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,680
Ocean!

630
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,637
Do something! Help us!

631
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,235
The ocean doesn't help you,
you help yourself!

632
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,913
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

633
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,079
You can't sail?

634
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,594
I, uh...

635
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,318
I am self-taught.

636
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,836
Can't you shapeshift or something?

637
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,035
Do you see my hook?

638
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,792
No magic hook, no magic powers!

639
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,556
Their boat is turning into more boats!

640
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,674
Yep, I just did that.

641
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,509
No, no!

642
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,592
Heihei!

643
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,034
Maui!

644
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,200
They took the heart!

645
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,749
That's a chicken.

646
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,911
The heart is in the...

647
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
We have to get him back!

648
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,560
Maui!

649
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,112
Cheeeehoooo!

650
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,872
There! Right there!

651
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,040
You're turning?

652
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,315
What are you doing?

653
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,595
Escaping!

654
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,955
The heart!

655
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,918
Forget it! You'll never get it back!

656
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,071
Besides, you got a better one.

657
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,160
Hey!

658
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,320
What am I gonna steer with?

659
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,118
They're just gonna kill ya!

660
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,549
Coconuts.

661
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,634
Got it!

662
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,400
Hey!

663
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,400
Yeah!

664
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,480
We did it!

665
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,996
Congratulations
on not being dead, girlie.

666
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,508
You surprise me.

667
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,916
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

668
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,478
You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta
go through a whole ocean of bad.

669
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,954
Not to mention Te Kā.

670
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,873
Lava monster?

671
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,032
Ever defeat a lava monster?

672
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,915
No. Have you?

673
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,637
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

674
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,039
You can't restore the heart without me...

675
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,952
and me says no.

676
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,398
I'm getting my hook.

677
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,400
End of discussion.

678
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,390
You'd be a hero.

679
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,790
That's what you're all about, right?

680
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,793
Little girl, I am a hero.

681
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,439
Maybe you were.

682
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,715
But now...

683
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,792
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

684
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,269
The guy who cursed the world.

685
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,999
You're no one's hero.

686
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,348
No one?

687
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
But...

688
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,198
put this back...

689
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,112
save the world...

690
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,271
you'd be everyone's hero.

691
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,117
Maui! Maui! Maui!

692
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,472
You're so amazing!

693
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,759
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Kā.

694
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,989
Then we get your hook.

695
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,875
We get your hook, take out Te Kā,
restore the heart.

696
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,679
Unless you don't wanna be...

697
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,957
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

698
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,639
Hero to...

699
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,229
all.

700
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,478
First, we get my hook.

701
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,233
Then save the world.

702
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,320
Deal?

703
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,440
Deal.

704
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,875
Worth a shot.

705
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,712
Okay, we go east.

706
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,029
To the lair of Tamatoa.

707
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,675
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

708
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,553
Teach me to sail.

709
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,230
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

710
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,400
I should...

711
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,671
I should be sailing.

712
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,871
It's called wayfinding, princess.

713
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,397
And it's not just sails and knots...

714
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,194
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

715
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,397
Knowing where you are...

716
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,159
by knowing where you've been.

717
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,675
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

718
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,440
I am the daughter of the chief.

719
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,629
- Same difference.
- No.

720
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,439
If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick...

721
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,715
you're a princess.

722
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,069
You are not a wayfinder.

723
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,677
You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...

724
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,315
Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?

725
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,319
You are a bad person.

726
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,238
If you can talk, you can teach.

727
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Wayfinding.

728
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,398
Lesson one. Hit it.

729
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,234
Pull the sheet.

730
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,638
Not the sheet.

731
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,800
No.

732
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,880
Nope.

733
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,996
Nope. No.

734
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,758
Tried that one already.

735
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,908
You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.

736
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,198
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

737
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,599
It's cold.

738
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,399
Wait, it's getting warmer.

739
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,519
Aah! That is disgusting!
What is wrong with you?

740
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,479
We're here?

741
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,669
See, told you I could do it!

742
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,393
Motunui?

743
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,192
I'm home?

744
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,518
- Moana!
- Dad?

745
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,992
Moana!

746
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,309
Mom?

747
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,874
Help!

748
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,760
No!

749
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,395
Moana!

750
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,992
Enjoy your beauty rest?

751
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,840
You know,
a real wayfinder never sleeps...

752
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,639
so they actually get
where they need to go.

753
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,679
Muscle up, buttercup.

754
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,799
We're here.

755
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,470
You're sure this guy's gonna
have your hook?

756
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,876
Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.

757
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,074
He's a scavenger. Collects stuff.
Thinks it makes him look cool.

758
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,160
Ah!

759
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,757
And for Tamatoa, trust me...

760
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,474
my hook is the coolest collectible.

761
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,552
And he lives up there?

762
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,560
No, no, no.

763
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,159
That's just the entrance...

764
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,515
to Lalotai.

765
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,949
Lalotai?

766
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,872
Realm of monsters?

767
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,397
We're going to the realm of monsters?

768
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,035
We? No. Me.

769
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,637
You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.

770
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,112
That's what I'm talking about.
Gimme some.

771
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,675
Come on. That was a good one.
How do you not get it?

772
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,035
I called her a chicken,
there's a chicken on the boat.

773
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,960
I know she's human,
but that's not the...

774
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,593
You know what? Forget it. Forget it!

775
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,239
I'm not explaining it to you.

776
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,038
'Cause then it's not funny.

777
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,870
So, daughter of the chief...

778
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,519
I thought you stayed in the village.

779
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,352
You know, kissing babies and things.

780
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,271
Hey, I'm just trying to understand...

781
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,869
why your people decided to send...

782
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,110
How do I phrase this? You.

783
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,551
My people didn't send me.

784
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,869
The ocean did.

785
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,268
The ocean?

786
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,440
Makes sense.

787
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,192
You're what, eight? Can't sail.

788
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,554
Obvious choice.

789
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,110
It chose me for a reason.

790
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,838
If the ocean's so smart...

791
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,112
why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

792
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,032
Or bring me my hook?

793
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,430
The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.

794
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,312
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

795
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,395
You're the Chosen One!

796
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,390
The ocean chose you for a reason.

797
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,154
If you start singing,
I'm gonna throw up.

798
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,996
So, not seeing an entrance.

799
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,317
Yes, because it only appears...

800
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,311
after a human sacrifice.

801
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,679
Kidding.

802
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,108
So serious.

803
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,840
Don't worry...

804
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,196
it's a lot farther down than it looks.

805
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,360
Cheeeehoooo!

806
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,558
I am still falling!

807
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,874
You can do this.

808
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,675
Go!

809
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,433
And he sticks the landing.

810
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,720
Huh?

811
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,110
What? Dum-dum, she's not even here.

812
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,589
No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of...

813
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,795
Huh?

814
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,991
Well, she's dead.

815
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,637
Okay, let's get my hook.

816
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,919
Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew.

817
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,790
Maui's fishhook!

818
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,359
Yeah!

819
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,238
Sorry!

820
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,536
I thought you were a monster...

821
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,788
But I found your hook.

822
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,256
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy
really likes his treasure.

823
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,280
Stay.

824
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,635
What? No. I'm the one who found...

825
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,319
Listen. For a thousand years...

826
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,675
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky...

827
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,909
getting my hook...

828
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,638
and being awesome again.

829
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,195
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal...

830
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,069
who has no business
inside of a monster cave, except...

831
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,318
Except...

832
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,708
maybe as bait.

833
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,074
Huh?

834
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,829
Wow!

835
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,036
The shiny, glittery cave.

836
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,553
And just like me...

837
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,359
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

838
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,397
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

839
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,993
You're not selling it!

840
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,120
This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

841
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,714
You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.

842
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,229
Oh, when he shows up,
keep him distracted.

843
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,879
Make him talk about himself.

844
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,196
He loves bragging about
how great he is.

845
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,839
You two must get along swell.

846
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,032
No, not since I ripped off his leg.

847
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,352
You ripped off his...

848
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,520
Maui?

849
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,553
What have we here?

850
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,234
It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute.

851
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,551
Ugh! It's a human!

852
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,395
What are you doing down here,
in the realm of the...

853
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,959
Just pick an eye, babe.

854
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,240
I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying if you keep...

855
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,231
Yeah, pick one, pick one!

856
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,711
You're a funny-looking little thing,
aren't you?

857
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,313
Don't! That's my gramma's!

858
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,549
"That's my gramma's!"

859
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,789
I ate my gramma!

860
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,434
And it took a week,
'cause she was absolutely humongous.

861
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,238
Why are you here?

862
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,919
'Cause you're amazing!

863
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:06,393
And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!

864
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,114
And I just had to know...

865
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,840
how you became so...

866
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,469
crabulous?

867
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,074
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

868
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,112
Because if you are...

869
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,356
I will gladly do so.

870
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,440
Huh?

871
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,919
In song form!

872
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,750
Well, Tamatoa
hasn't always been this glam

873
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,275
I was a drab little crab once

874
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,359
Now I know I can be happy as a clam

875
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,795
Because I'm beautiful, baby

876
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,109
And did your granny say

877
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,998
Listen to your heart

878
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,958
Be who you are on the inside

879
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,430
I need three words
To tear her argument apart

880
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,959
Your granny lied

881
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,838
I'd rather be shiny

882
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,878
Like a treasure
From a sunken pirate wreck

883
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,510
Scrub the deck
And make it look shiny

884
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,513
I will sparkle like a
Wealthy woman's neck

885
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,230
Just a sec
Don't ya know

886
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,234
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters

887
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,834
Beginners

888
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,469
Oh, and here they come, come, come

889
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,676
To the brightest thing that glitters

890
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:19,880
Mm, fish dinners

891
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,395
I just love free food

892
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,878
And you look like seafood

893
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,071
Hey, crab cake!

894
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,353
I'm back.

895
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,910
It's Maui Time!

896
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,880
What do you say, little buddy?

897
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,558
Giant hawk? Coming up!

898
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,073
Cheeeehoooo!

899
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,117
Cheeeehoooo!

900
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,391
Well, well, well.

901
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,869
Little Maui's having
trouble with his look

902
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,836
Ya little semi-demi-mini-god

903
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,590
Ouch
What a terrible performance

904
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,199
Get the hook
Get it?

905
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,079
You don't swing it
Like you used to, man

906
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,718
Yet I have to give you
Credit for my start

907
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,838
And your tattoos on the outside

908
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,317
For just like you
I made myself a work of art

909
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,556
I'll never hide
I can't

910
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,755
I'm too shiny

911
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,878
Watch me dazzle
Like a diamond in the rough

912
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,396
Strut my stuff
My stuff is so shiny

913
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,068
Send your armies
But they'll never be enough

914
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,868
My shell's too tough
Maui, man

915
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,435
You can try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod

916
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,430
To beat a decapod
Look it up

917
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,398
You will die, die, die

918
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,392
Now it's time for me to take apart

919
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,917
Your achin' heart

920
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,677
Far from the ones who abandoned you

921
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:59,512
Chasing the love of these humans

922
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,637
Who made you feel wanted

923
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,428
You tried to be tough

924
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,639
But your armor's just not hard enough

925
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,597
Maui
Now it's time to kick your heinie

926
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,398
Ever seen someone so shiny

927
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,672
Soak it in
'Cause it's the last you'll ever see

928
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,439
C'est la vie
Mon ami

929
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,119
I'm so shiny

930
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,079
Now I eat you so
prepare your final plea

931
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,349
Just for me

932
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,109
You'll never be quite as shiny

933
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,434
You wish you were nice and shiny

934
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,309
- Hey!
- Huh?

935
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,792
I got something shiny for ya!

936
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,315
The heart of Te Fiti.

937
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,789
You can't run from me!

938
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,957
Oh, you can. You keep surprising me.

939
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,675
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

940
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,438
The power of creation...

941
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,273
for a crustacean.

942
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,913
Where is it? Where is it?

943
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,152
We gotta go!

944
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,840
What about the heart?

945
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,468
He can have it. I've got a better one.

946
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,159
Yes, I have the...

947
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,320
Wait a minute.

948
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,320
I see, she's taken a barnacle
and she's covered it in...

949
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,671
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

950
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,035
Come back here!

951
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,829
Cheeeehoooo!

952
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,959
Hey!

953
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,678
Did you like the song?

954
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,714
We're alive!

955
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,680
Listen...

956
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,791
I appreciate what you did down there.

957
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,109
Mm-hmm.

958
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,235
- Took guts.
- Mm-hmm.

959
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,549
- But...
- Mm-hmm.

960
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,760
I'm sorry.

961
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,957
I'm trying to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

962
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,031
No, no. No way!

963
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,475
Really? Because you're looking at me
like I have a...

964
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,555
shark head.

965
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,871
What? Do you have a shark head?

966
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,752
Look, the point is...

967
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,792
for a little girl, child, thing,
whatever...

968
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,520
who had no business
being down there...

969
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,438
you did me a solid.

970
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,676
But you also almost died.

971
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,920
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

972
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,230
So, chances of beating Te Kā?

973
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,549
Bupkis.

974
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,996
We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

975
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,395
It's not cursed.

976
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,120
Shark head.

977
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,999
It is not cursed.

978
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,160
Cursed.

979
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,430
What can I say except

980
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,431
We're dead soon

981
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,119
We're dead soon

982
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,071
Can you at least try?

983
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,431
Giant hawk.

984
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,396
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
We're dead soon

985
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,191
All right, break time's over.

986
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,360
Get up.

987
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,875
Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

988
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,794
Tell me I can beat Te Kā
'cause I'm "Maui?"

989
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,629
Take a hike, Tiny.

990
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,108
How do you get your tattoos?

991
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,755
They show up. When I earn them.

992
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,553
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

993
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,030
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

994
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,315
What's Nunya?

995
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,799
Nunya business.

996
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,753
I'll just keep asking.

997
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,040
What's it for?

998
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,830
You need to stop doing that.

999
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,197
- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is.

1000
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,839
I said back off.

1001
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,672
Is it why your hook's not working?

1002
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,433
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

1003
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,831
You wanna throw me off the boat...

1004
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,958
throw me off.

1005
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,430
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

1006
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,552
I know I don't.

1007
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,717
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1008
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,598
You're right.

1009
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:50,193
But my island is dying...

1010
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,032
so I am here.

1011
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,075
It's just me and you.

1012
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,913
And I want to help...

1013
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,392
but I can't if you don't let me.

1014
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,320
I wasn't born a demigod.

1015
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,116
I had human parents.

1016
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,439
They took one look and decided...

1017
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,068
they did not want me.

1018
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,516
They threw me into the sea...

1019
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,117
like I was nothing.

1020
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:35,116
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1021
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,918
They gave me the hook.

1022
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,749
They made me...

1023
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,600
Maui.

1024
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,633
And back to the humans I went.

1025
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,959
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1026
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,269
Anything they could ever want.

1027
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,275
You took the heart for them.

1028
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,878
You did everything for them.

1029
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,511
So they'd love you.

1030
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,271
It was never enough.

1031
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,716
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1032
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,031
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1033
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:24,318
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1034
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,155
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1035
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,068
You are.

1036
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,351
Okay, okay.

1037
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,834
I love you, too, buddy.

1038
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,874
Cheeeehoooo!

1039
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,800
Yeah!

1040
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,639
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1041
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,480
What?

1042
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,119
I figured it out.

1043
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,189
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

1044
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:18,148
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1045
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,758
All those new lands, new villages.

1046
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,594
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1047
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,638
And if I were the ocean...

1048
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,918
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

1049
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,471
to start that again.

1050
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:38,031
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1051
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,196
Probably should have saved it
for Te Fiti.

1052
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,909
I did.

1053
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,910
Moana of Motunui...

1054
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:54,712
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

1055
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,354
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1056
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,597
You're so amazing!

1057
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,400
It's time.

1058
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,233
Go save the world.

1059
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,352
Cheeeehoooo!

1060
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,672
Maui!

1061
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,868
What are you doing?

1062
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,798
Finding you a better way in!

1063
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,198
- We won't make it!
- Yes, we will!

1064
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,475
- Turn around!
- No!

1065
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,755
Moana, stop!

1066
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:32,960
No!

1067
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,632
Are you okay?

1068
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,200
Maui?

1069
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,951
I told you to turn back.

1070
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,992
I thought we could make it.

1071
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,389
We?

1072
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,950
I thought I could make it.

1073
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,034
We can fix it.

1074
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,316
It was made by the gods.

1075
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,238
You can't fix it!

1076
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,755
Next time we'll be more careful.

1077
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,076
Te Kā was stuck on the barrier islands.

1078
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,674
It's lava, it can't go in the water.

1079
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,831
We can find a way around.

1080
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,831
I'm not going back.

1081
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,558
We still have to restore the heart.

1082
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,239
My hook is cracked.

1083
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,072
One more hit, and it's over.

1084
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,317
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1085
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,358
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1086
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,669
That's not true!

1087
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,348
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1088
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,148
We are only here...

1089
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,472
because you stole the heart
in the first place.

1090
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,399
No, we're here because
the ocean told you you're special...

1091
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,357
and you believed it.

1092
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,068
I am Moana of Motunui.

1093
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,475
- You will board my boat...
- Goodbye, Moana.

1094
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,789
...sail across the sea...

1095
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,029
I'm not killing myself...

1096
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,616
so you can prove
you're something you're not!

1097
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,080
...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1098
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,989
The ocean chose me!

1099
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,632
It chose wrong.

1100
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,429
Maui!

1101
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,908
Why did you bring me here?

1102
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,751
I'm not the right person.

1103
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,433
You have to choose someone else.

1104
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,320
Choose someone else.

1105
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,439
Please.

1106
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,788
No.

1107
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,989
You're a long ways
past the reef.

1108
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,360
Gramma?

1109
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,352
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1110
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:09,840
Gramma!

1111
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,556
I tried, Gramma.

1112
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,152
I couldn't do it.

1113
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,434
It's not your fault.

1114
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,354
I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.

1115
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,191
If you are ready to go home...

1116
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,671
I will be with you.

1117
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,878
Why do you hesitate?

1118
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,952
I don't know.

1119
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,869
I know a girl from an island

1120
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,593
She stands apart from the crowd

1121
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,032
She loves the sea and her people

1122
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,710
She makes her whole family proud

1123
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,599
Sometimes the world
seems against you

1124
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,118
The journey may leave a scar

1125
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,078
But scars can heal and reveal just

1126
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,834
Where you are

1127
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,752
The people you love will change you

1128
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,998
The things you have
learned will guide you

1129
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,596
And nothing on earth can silence

1130
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,752
The quiet voice still inside you

1131
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,437
And when that voice starts to whisper

1132
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,239
Moana, you've come so far

1133
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,752
Moana, listen

1134
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,596
Do you know who you are?

1135
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,273
Who am I?

1136
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,756
I am a girl who loves my island

1137
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:05,709
And the girl who loves the sea

1138
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,192
It calls me

1139
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,158
I am the daughter of the village chief

1140
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,598
We are descended from voyagers

1141
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,309
Who found their way across the world

1142
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,756
They call me

1143
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,948
I've delivered us to where we are

1144
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,313
I have journeyed farther

1145
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,189
I am everything I've learned and more

1146
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,357
Still it calls me

1147
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,795
And the call isn't out there at all

1148
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,758
It's inside me

1149
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,156
It's like the tide

1150
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:49,552
Always falling and rising

1151
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,474
I will carry you here in my heart

1152
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,712
You remind me

1153
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,838
That come what may

1154
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,992
I know the way

1155
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:06,756
I am Moana

1156
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,395
I am Moana of Motunui.

1157
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,880
Aboard my boat...

1158
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,395
I will sail across the sea...

1159
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,718
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

1160
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,911
Te Kā can't follow us into the water.

1161
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,280
We make it past the barrier islands...

1162
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,229
we make it to Te Fiti.

1163
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,080
None of which you understand...

1164
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,440
because you are a chicken.

1165
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,880
No!

1166
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,594
Heihei! No, no, no!

1167
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,309
Nice work!

1168
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:02,835
Te Fiti.

1169
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,200
Maui!

1170
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,915
You came back.

1171
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,034
But your hook.

1172
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,713
One more hit and...

1173
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,033
Te Ka's gotta catch me first.

1174
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,360
I got your back, Chosen One.

1175
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,720
Go save the world.

1176
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,800
Maui.

1177
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,715
Thank you.

1178
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,999
You're welcome.

1179
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,272
Cheeeehoooo!

1180
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,155
Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!

1181
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,119
Hey, Te Kā!

1182
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,840
Shark head!

1183
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,509
Cheeeehoooo!

1184
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:46,960
Moana!

1185
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,157
Get the heart to the spiral!

1186
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,116
Te Fiti...

1187
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,713
it's gone.

1188
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,032
Te Kā!

1189
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,075
Let her come to me.

1190
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,070
I have crossed the horizon to find you

1191
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,715
I know your name

1192
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:16,354
They have stolen the
heart from inside you

1193
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,192
But this does not define you

1194
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,799
This is not who you are

1195
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:38,719
You know who you are

1196
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:48,199
Who you truly are.

1197
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,389
Te Fiti!

1198
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,353
The chicken lives.

1199
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,191
I'm sorry about your hook.

1200
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:01,712
Well, hook, no hook...

1201
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,792
I'm Maui.

1202
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,475
Te Fiti!

1203
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:27,471
Hey, I mean, how you been?

1204
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,234
Look, what I did was...

1205
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,833
wrong.

1206
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,036
I have no excuse.

1207
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:38,755
I'm sorry.

1208
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,230
You know, it'd be rude to refuse
a gift from a goddess.

1209
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,231
Cheeeehoooo!

1210
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,080
Thank you.

1211
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,754
Your kind gesture is
deeply appreciated.

1212
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,920
Cheeeehoooo.

1213
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,073
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1214
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,560
You could come with us, you know.

1215
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:56,835
My people are going to need
a master wayfinder.

1216
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,151
They already have one.

1217
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,755
See you out there, Maui.

1218
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,955
See you out there, Moana.

1219
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:24,834
Cheeeehoooo!

1220
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,872
Mom! Dad!

1221
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,189
Moana!

1222
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:31,751
I may have gone
a little ways past the reef.

1223
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,718
It suits you.

1224
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:35,920
She's back!

1225
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,216
Moana!

1226
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,240
Pua!

1227
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,240
Moana!

1228
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:44,839
Welcome home!

1229
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,955
We set a course to find

1230
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:41,352
A brand new island
everywhere we roam

1231
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:46,029
We keep our island in our mind

1232
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:50,792
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

1233
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,517
We are explorers reading every sign

1234
01:35:56,120 --> 01:36:00,318
We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain

1235
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:12,596
We know the way

1236
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:08,919
Shiny

1237
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,954
I'm so shiny

1238
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:14,357
Didn't help me though, did it?

1239
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,476
Still upside down here.

1240
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,910
Just need a little push.

1241
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,080
Can we be real?

1242
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:25,630
If my name was Sebastian
and I had a cool Jamaican accent...

1243
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:26,994
you'd totally help me.

1244
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,798
You would. You know you would.
