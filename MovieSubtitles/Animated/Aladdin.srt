1
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:33,496
<i>Oh l Come from a land,
From a faraWay plaCe</i>

2
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:36,738
<i>Where the Caravan Camels roam</i>

3
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:40,422
<i>Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense</i>

4
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,863
<i>lt's barbariC but hey, it's home</i>

5
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:47,417
<i>When the Wind's from the east
And the sun's from the West</i>

6
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:50,465
<i>And the sand in the glass is right</i>

7
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:54,699
<i>Come on doWn, stop on by,
Hop a Carpet and fly</i>

8
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:58,905
<i>To another Arabian night</i>

9
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:02,457
<i>Arabian nights</i>

10
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:06,017
<i>Like Arabian days</i>

11
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,736
<i>More often than not
Are hotter than hot</i>

12
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:13,297
<i>ln a lot of good Ways</i>

13
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:16,743
<i>Arabian nights</i>

14
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:20,263
<i>'Neath Arabian moons</i>

15
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:24,260
<i>A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard</i>

16
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:27,737
<i>Out there on the dunes</i>

17
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:35,942
<i>Salaam and good evening to you,
worthy friend.</i>

18
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:38,018
Please come closer.

19
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:40,579
Too close. A little too close.

20
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,259
There.

21
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:44,577
Welcome to Agrabah.

22
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,022
City of mystery.

23
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,779
Of enchantment.

24
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:52,746
And the finest merchandise this side
of the river Jordan. Come on down.

25
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:55,944
Look at this. Combination hookah
and coffee maker.

26
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:58,336
Also makes julienne fries.

27
00:01:58,427 --> 00:02:00,418
Will not break.

28
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:02,577
lt broke.

29
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:07,460
Look at this. l have never seen
one of these intact before.

30
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:11,096
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen.

31
00:02:11,187 --> 00:02:12,415
Still good.

32
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,416
Wait, don't go!

33
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:18,261
l can see you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.

34
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:22,340
l think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.

35
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,135
Do not be fooled
by its commonplace appearance.

36
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:28,377
Like so many things,
it is not what is outside,

37
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:31,459
but what is inside that counts.

38
00:02:31,547 --> 00:02:33,105
This is no ordinary lamp.

39
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:35,940
lt once changed the course
of a young man's life.

40
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:40,100
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.

41
00:02:40,187 --> 00:02:42,655
A diamond in the rough.

42
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,977
Perhaps you would like
to hear the tale?

43
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:48,503
lt begins on a dark night.

44
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:55,743
Where a dark man waits
with a dark purpose.

45
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:02,903
You are late.

46
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:05,785
A thousand apologies, oh patient one.

47
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,779
- You have it, then?
- l had to slit a few throats.

48
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,823
But l got it.

49
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:14,623
The treasure.

50
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:22,101
Trust me, my pungent friend.
You'll get what's coming to you.

51
00:03:22,187 --> 00:03:24,257
What's coming to you.

52
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,422
Quickly, follow the trail.

53
00:03:38,187 --> 00:03:40,143
Faster.

54
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:02,221
At last, after all
my years of searching.

55
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:05,105
The cave of wonders.

56
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:07,098
Cave of wonders.

57
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:09,576
By Allah.

58
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:13,626
Now, remember.
Bring me the lamp.

59
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:18,144
The rest of the treasure is yours,
but the lamp is mine.

60
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:23,744
The lamp. The lamp.

61
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:26,864
Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?

62
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:43,946
Who disturbs my slumber?

63
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:48,262
lt is l. Gazeem.

64
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:50,258
A humble thief.

65
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:54,863
Know this. Only one may enter here.

66
00:04:54,947 --> 00:04:58,144
One whose worth lies far within.

67
00:04:58,227 --> 00:05:00,980
The diamond in the rough.

68
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,258
What are you waiting for? Go on.

69
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:23,386
No!

70
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:27,540
Seek thee out
the diamond in the rough.

71
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:36,904
l can't believe it.
l just don't believe it.

72
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:41,026
We're never going to get ahold
of that stupid lamp.

73
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,335
Just forget it.

74
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:46,625
Look at this.
l'm so ticked off that l'm molting.

75
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:49,858
Patience, lago. Patience.

76
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:53,701
Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.

77
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,426
There's a big surprise.

78
00:05:56,507 --> 00:06:00,261
l think l'm gonna have a heart attack
and die from that surprise.

79
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:04,226
What are we going to do?
We got a big problem here, a big...

80
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:06,704
Yes.

81
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:09,745
Only one may enter.

82
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:14,901
l must find this one,
this diamond in the rough.

83
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:17,817
Stop, thief!

84
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:21,217
l'll have your hands
for a trophy, street rat.

85
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,903
All this for a loaf of bread?

86
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:38,377
- There he is.
- You won't get away so easy.

87
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,423
You think that was easy?

88
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,546
You two, over that way.
And you, follow me. We'll find him.

89
00:06:45,627 --> 00:06:48,903
- Morning, ladies.
- Getting into trouble early today,

90
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:50,466
aren't we, Aladdin?

91
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:51,821
Trouble? No way.

92
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:53,943
You're only in trouble
if you get caught.

93
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:55,255
- Gotcha.
- l'm in trouble.

94
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:56,780
And this time...

95
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:00,499
Perfect timing, Abu.
As usual.

96
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:03,186
Let's get outta here.

97
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:05,701
<i>Got to keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line</i>

98
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:07,778
<i>One sWing ahead of the sWord</i>

99
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:10,062
<i>l steal only What l Can't afford</i>

100
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:11,500
That's everything.

101
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:13,225
<i>One jump ahead of the laWmen</i>

102
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,298
<i>That's all, and that's no joke</i>

103
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:18,265
<i>These guys don't appreCiate l'm broke</i>

104

00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,339

106
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:26,340
<i>Just a little snaCk, guys</i>

107
00:07:26,427 --> 00:07:30,181
<i>Rip him open, take it baCk, guys</i>

108
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,064
<i>l Can take a hint
Got to faCe the faCts</i>

109
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,865
<i>- You're my only friend, Abu
- Who?</i>

110
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:36,745
<i>Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom</i>

111
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,296
<i>He's beCome a one-man rise in Crime</i>

112
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:44,936
<i>l'd blame parents,

113
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:49,384
<i>Got to eat to live, got to steal to eat
Tell you all about it When l got time</i>

114
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:52,743
<i>One jump ahead of the sloWpokes,
One skip ahead of my doom</i>

115
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:54,658
<i>Next time, going to use a nom de plume</i>

116
00:07:54,747 --> 00:07:56,385
There he is.

117
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:59,857
<i>One jump ahead of the hit men,
One hit ahead of the floCk</i>

118

<i>l think l'll take a stroll
Around the bloCk</i>

119
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:05,699
- Stop, thief.
- Vandal.

120
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:07,425
- Abu.
- Scandal.

121
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:11,500
<i>Let's not be too hasty</i>

122
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:15,466
<i>Still l think he's rather tasty</i>

123
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:18,664
<i>Got to eat to live, got to steal to eat,
Otherwise We'd get along</i>

124
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,385
<i>Wrong</i>

125
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:23,258
Get him!

126
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,578
He's got a sword.

127
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:34,139
You idiots.
We've all got swords.

128
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:44,863
<i>One jump ahead of the hoof beats
One hop ahead of the hump</i>

132
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:07,427
<i>And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.</i>

133
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:10,066
<i>And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.</i>

134
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:35,461
Here.

135
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:37,538
Go on, take it.

136
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:53,823
Ah, don't.

137
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,861
On his way to the palace, l suppose.

138
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:06,303
Another suitor for the princess.

139
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,704
Out of my way, you filthy brats.

140
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:15,302
Hey! lf l were as rich as you,
l could afford some manners.

141
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:18,981
l'll teach you some manners.

142
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:24,700
Look at that, Abu.

143
00:10:24,787 --> 00:10:27,665
lt's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.

144
00:10:29,187 --> 00:10:32,099
You are a worthless street rat.

145
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:35,099
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat

146
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:38,145
and only your fleas will mourn you.

147
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:45,181
l'm not worthless.
And l don't have fleas.

148
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:51,226
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.

149
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:00,540
<i>Riffraff, street rat</i>

150
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,016
<i>l don't buy that</i>

151
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:07,498
<i>lf only they'd look Closer</i>

152
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:10,704
<i>Would they see a poor boy?</i>

153
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:12,584
<i>No siree</i>

154
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:17,698
<i>They'd find out</i>

155
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:24,738
<i>There's so muCh more to me</i>

156
00:11:29,827 --> 00:11:33,456
Some day, Abu,
things are going to change.

157
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:38,302
We'll be rich, live in a palace
and never have any problems at all.

158
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:45,426
- l've never been so insulted.
- Prince Achmed.

159
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:48,544
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

160
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:50,583
Good luck marrying her off.

161
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:53,226
Jasmine.

162
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:02,418
<i>Confound it, Rajah.</i>

163
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:08,658
So this is why
Prince Achmed stormed out.

164
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:12,899
<i>Oh, Father. Rajah was just playing
with him. Weren't you, Rajah?</i>

165
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:15,217
You were just playing
with that overdressed,

166
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:18,060
self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
weren't you?

167
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:25,899
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

168
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:31,619
The law says you must be married
to a prince by your next birthday.

169
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:35,336
- The law is wrong.
- You've only got three more days.

170
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:38,976
Father, l hate being forced into this.

171
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:42,218
lf l do marry,
l want it to be for love.

172
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:47,461
Jasmine, it's not only this law.

173
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,977
l'm not going
to be around forever, and...

174
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:57,615
l just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

175
00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:01,541
- Provided for.
- Please try to understand.

176
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:05,700
l've never done a thing on my own.
l've never had any real friends.

177
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:08,465
<i>Except you, Rajah.</i>

178
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:12,541
l've never even been
outside the palace walls.

179
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:15,300
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

180
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:19,062
Then maybe l don't want to be
a princess anymore.

181
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:23,979
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

182
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:42,019
l don't know where she gets it from.
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

183
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:48,620
Jafar, my most trusted advisor.

184
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:51,380
l am in desperate need of your wisdom.

185
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:54,379
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

186
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:58,540
lt's this suitor business.
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.

187
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:00,219
l'm at my wits' end.

188
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,706
Wits' end.

189
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:06,098
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.

190
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:11,064
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.

191
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:13,776
Now, then.

192
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:18,543
Perhaps l can divine a solution
to this thorny problem.

193
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:20,265
lf anyone can help, it's you.

194
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:25,341
But it would require
the use of the mystic blue diamond.

195
00:14:26,307 --> 00:14:28,184
My ring?

196
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:33,580
- But it's been in the family for years.
- lt is necessary to find a suitor.

197
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,464
Don't worry.

198
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:39,062
Everything will be fine.

199
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:41,581
Everything will be... fine.

200
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,658
The diamond.

201
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:45,942
Here, Jafar.

202
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:49,542
Whatever you need will be fine.

203
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:52,095
You are most gracious, my liege.

204
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:55,736
Now run along
and play with your little toys.

205
00:14:57,347 --> 00:15:00,305
That will be pretty good.

206
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:04,343
l can't take it anymore.

207
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:10,184
lf l gotta choke down on one more
of those moldy, disgusting crackers...

208
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:15,345
Calm yourself, lago.

209
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:19,500
Soon l will be sultan,
not that addle-pated twit.

210
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:24,183
And then l stuff the crackers
down his throat.

211
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,863
<i>l'm sorry, Rajah.</i>

212
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:47,940
But l can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.

213
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,858
l'll miss you.

214
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,018
Goodbye.

215
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:12,015
Oranges from Jaffa.

216
00:16:12,107 --> 00:16:14,098
Ok, Abu. Go.

217
00:16:15,427 --> 00:16:19,579
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

218
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:23,657
Get your paws off that.

219
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:28,502
Why, you... Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape.

220
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,465
Bye-bye.

221
00:16:31,547 --> 00:16:33,538
Nice going Abu.

222
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,818
Breakfast is served.

223
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:44,779
Pretty lady, buy a pot.
No finer pot in brass or silver.

224
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:49,383
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.
Sugar dates and pistachios.

225
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:53,460
Would the lady like a necklace?
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

226
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:56,141
Fresh fish. We catch 'em, you buy them.

227
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:58,582
No. l don't think so.

228
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:01,778
Excuse me.

229
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,500
l'm really very sorry.

230
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:20,220
Hello?

231
00:17:23,827 --> 00:17:25,545
You must be hungry.

232
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,984
- Here you go.
- You'd better be able to pay for that.

233
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:33,377
- Pay?
- No one steals from my cart.

234
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:36,106
l'm sorry, sir.
l don't have any money.

235
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:37,700
- Thief!
- Please.

236
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:40,620
lf you let me go to the palace,
l can get some from the sultan.

237
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:43,779
Do you know what
the penalty is for stealing?

238
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:45,380
No, please.

239
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:48,698
Thank you, kind sir.
l'm so glad you found her.

240
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:51,062
- l've been looking for you.
- What are you doing?

241
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:54,503
- Just play along.
- You know this girl?

242
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:57,420
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

243
00:17:57,507 --> 00:18:00,738
- She's a little crazy.
- She said she knew the sultan.

244
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,380
She thinks the monkey
is the sultan.

245
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:10,545
O wise Sultan, how may l serve you?

246
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:14,983
Tragic, isn't it?

247
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:17,223
But no harm done.

248
00:18:17,307 --> 00:18:19,901
Come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

249
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:24,344
- Hello, doctor. How are you?
- No, not that one.

250
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:26,418
Come on, Sultan.

251
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:30,865
What is it?

252
00:18:30,947 --> 00:18:33,541
Come back here, you little thieves.

253
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:40,300
<i>With all due respect,
Your Rottenness,</i>

254
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,823
couldn't we just wait
for a real storm?

255
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:45,818
Save your breath, lago. Faster.

256
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:49,545
Yes, oh mighty evil one.

257
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,623
Part, sands of time.

258
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:58,586
<i>Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.</i>

259
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:01,943
Yes.

260
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:04,302
There he is.

261
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:06,776
My diamond in the rough.

262
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:10,303
That's him? That's the clown
we've been waiting for?

263
00:19:10,387 --> 00:19:15,177
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace.

264
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:18,259
- Shall we?
- Swell.

265
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:24,618
Almost there.

266
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:35,376
l want to thank you
for stopping that man.

267
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,900
Forget it.

268
00:19:37,947 --> 00:19:41,337
So this is your first time
in the marketplace, huh?

269
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:44,785
ls it that obvious?

270
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,825
Well, you do kind of stand out.

271
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:53,026
l mean, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

272
00:19:55,147 --> 00:19:57,536
l'm a fast learner.

273
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,222
Come on. This way.

274
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:08,658
Watch your head there.
Be careful.

275
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:12,501
- ls this where you live?
- Yep. Just me and Abu.

276
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:15,659
- Come and go as we please.
- That sounds fabulous.

277
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,863
Well, it's not much.

278
00:20:17,947 --> 00:20:20,586
But it's got a great view.

279
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:24,501
The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?

280
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:26,418
lt's wonderful.

281
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:30,978
Wonder what it'd be like to live there.
And have servants and valets.

282
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:34,503
Oh, sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

283
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:39,746
That's better than here. Always
scraping for food and ducking guards.

284
00:20:39,827 --> 00:20:41,943
You're not free
to make your own choices.

285
00:20:42,027 --> 00:20:44,222
- Sometimes you feel so...
- You're just...

286
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:46,104
trapped.

287
00:20:51,027 --> 00:20:52,858
So where are you from?

288
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:58,025
What does it matter?
l ran away and l am not going back.

289
00:20:58,107 --> 00:21:00,098
<i>Really? How come?</i>

290
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:02,303
Why, you...

291
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:06,783
My father's forcing me
to get married.

292
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:09,222
That's awful.

293
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:15,139
What?

294
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,102
Abu says...

295
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:19,984
that's not fair.

296
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:22,865
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah. Of course.

297
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:26,622
And does Abu
have anything else to say?

298
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:29,938
He wishes there was something
he could do to help.

299
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,018
Oh, boy.

300
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:37,177
Tell him that's very sweet.

301
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:40,665
Here you are.

302
00:21:40,747 --> 00:21:42,385
They're after me. They're after you?

303
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,106
- My father must have sent them...
- Do you trust me?

304
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:46,905
- What?
- Do you trust me?

305
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:49,103
- Yes.
- Then jump!

306
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:59,418
We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?

307
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:02,177
<i>Run. Go, get out of here.</i>

308
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:06,703
lt's the dungeon for you, boy.

309
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:08,505
- Get off.
- Let him go.

310
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:12,262
Looky here, men.
A street mouse.

311
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:14,739
Unhand him.

312
00:22:14,827 --> 00:22:16,704
By order of the princess.

313
00:22:18,307 --> 00:22:20,775
- Princess Jasmine.
- The princess?

314
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:24,419
What are you doing here?
And with this street rat?

315
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:28,466
<i>That's not your concern.
Do as l command. Release him.</i>

316
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:32,256
l would, Princess.
Except my orders come from Jafar.

317
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:36,135
- You'll have to take it up with him.
- Believe me, l will.

318
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:43,904
Jafar?

319
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,739
Princess.

320
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:50,295
- Jafar, l'm stuck.
- How may l be of service to you?

321
00:22:50,387 --> 00:22:53,618
The guards took a boy from the market.
On your orders.

322
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:57,344
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

323
00:22:57,427 --> 00:23:00,225
- The boy was a criminal.
- What was his crime?

324
00:23:00,307 --> 00:23:02,867
- l can't breathe.
- Why...

325
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:07,384
- kidnapping the princess, of course.
- lf you could just... That hurt!

326
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,776
He didn't kidnap me.
l ran away.

327
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:13,064
Oh, dear.

328
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:16,742
How frightfully upsetting.
Had l but known...

329
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:18,385
What do you mean?

330
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:21,982
Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

331
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,535
- What sentence?
- Death.

332
00:23:25,347 --> 00:23:27,781
- By beheading.
- No.

333
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:34,223
l am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

334
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:36,298
How could you?

335
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,185
So. How did it go?

336
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:51,896
l think she took it rather well.

337
00:24:04,747 --> 00:24:06,783
<i>lt's all my fault, Rajah.</i>

338
00:24:09,187 --> 00:24:11,223
l didn't even know his name.

339
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:32,183
She was the princess.

340
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:34,781
l can't believe it.

341
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:37,427
l must have sounded
so stupid to her.

342
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:43,418
Abu, down here.

343
00:24:45,587 --> 00:24:47,623
Come on, help me out of these.

344
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:56,223
She was in trouble.

345
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:58,298
She was worth it.

346
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:01,781
Don't worry, l'll never see her again.

347
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:05,143
l'm a street rat, remember,
and there's a law.

348
00:25:05,227 --> 00:25:07,263
She's got to marry a prince.

349
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,975
She deserves a prince.

350
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:13,422
l'm a fool.

351
00:25:13,507 --> 00:25:17,341
You're only a fool
if you give up, boy.

352
00:25:17,427 --> 00:25:21,739
- Who are you?
- A lowly prisoner like yourself.

353
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:24,864
But together perhaps we can be more.

354
00:25:24,947 --> 00:25:28,701
- l'm listening.
- There is a cave, boy.

355
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:30,903
A cave of wonders,

356
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:35,344
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

357
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:40,462
Treasure enough to impress even
your princess, l'd wager.

358
00:25:40,547 --> 00:25:43,744
Jafar, can you hurry up?
l'm dying in here.

359
00:25:43,827 --> 00:25:45,818
But the law says that
only a prince...

360
00:25:45,907 --> 00:25:48,580
Haven't you heard
of the golden rule?

361
00:25:48,667 --> 00:25:51,579
Whoever has the gold
makes the rules.

362
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:55,260
So why would you share
this treasure with me?

363
00:25:55,347 --> 00:26:00,467
l need a young pair of legs
and a strong back to go in after it.

364
00:26:00,547 --> 00:26:03,823
One problem.
lt's out there and we're in here.

365
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:07,986
Things aren't always what they seem.

366
00:26:09,507 --> 00:26:13,341
So. Do we have a deal?

367
00:26:26,547 --> 00:26:30,506
Who disturbs my slumber?

368
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:34,616
lt is l. Aladdin.

369
00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:38,496
Proceed.

370
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:42,421
Touch nothing but the lamp.

371
00:26:42,507 --> 00:26:45,465
<i>Remember, boy.
First fetch me the lamp.</i>

372
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:49,335
And then you shall have your reward.

373
00:26:49,427 --> 00:26:51,418
Come on, Abu.

374
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:07,307
Would you look at that!

375
00:27:09,907 --> 00:27:14,219
Just a handful of this stuff
would make me richer than the sultan.

376
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:19,575
Don't touch anything.

377
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,658
We got to find that lamp.

378
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:54,867
Will you knock it off?

379
00:28:17,707 --> 00:28:19,379
Are you crazy?

380
00:28:21,547 --> 00:28:24,425
A magic carpet.

381
00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:27,579
Come on out.
We're not going to hurt you.

382
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:39,978
Take it easy.
He's not going to bite.

383
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:42,023
Thanks.

384
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,222
Wait a minute, don't go.

385
00:28:51,307 --> 00:28:53,263
Maybe you can help us.

386
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:00,227
You see, we're trying
to find this lamp.

387
00:29:01,627 --> 00:29:03,618
l think he knows where it is.

388
00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:21,258
Wait here.

389
00:29:53,507 --> 00:29:55,577
This is it?

390
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:57,862
This is what we came
all the way down here to...

391
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:01,100
No!

392
00:30:01,187 --> 00:30:03,826
lnfidels.

393
00:30:03,907 --> 00:30:08,776
You have touched the forbidden treasure.

394
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:17,224
Now you will never again
see the light of day.

395
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:52,257
Carpet, let's move.

396
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:10,537
This is no time to panic.

397
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:14,178
Start panicking.

398
00:31:43,227 --> 00:31:45,377
- Help me up.
- Throw me the lamp.

399
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:47,822
l can't hold on.
Give me your hand.

400
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,704
First give me the lamp.

401
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:57,424
Yes!

402
00:31:57,507 --> 00:32:00,067
At last.

403
00:32:03,027 --> 00:32:06,622
- What are you doing?
- Giving you your reward.

404
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:09,505
Your eternal reward.

405
00:32:36,147 --> 00:32:40,299
lt's mine. lt's all mine.

406
00:32:40,387 --> 00:32:42,742
l... where is it?

407
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,180
No.

408
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:46,098
No!

409
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:58,783
Oh, dearest. What's wrong?

410
00:33:00,707 --> 00:33:05,576
Jafar has done something terrible.

411
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:08,340
There there, my dear.

412
00:33:08,427 --> 00:33:10,383
We'll set it right.

413
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:13,220
Now, tell me everything.

414
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,623
Wake up.

415
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:25,223
My head.

416
00:33:27,347 --> 00:33:32,182
We're trapped.
That two-faced son of a jackal.

417
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:36,385
Well, whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.

418
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:42,306
Why, you hairy little thief.

419
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,663
lt looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

420
00:33:45,747 --> 00:33:48,466
l think there's something written here,

421
00:33:49,587 --> 00:33:51,623
but it's hard to make out.

422
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:11,940
Ten thousand years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

423
00:34:12,027 --> 00:34:14,461
Hang on a second.

424
00:34:15,507 --> 00:34:18,305
Wow, does it feel good
to be out of there.

425
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:23,415
Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.
Where are you from? What's your name?

426
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:24,940
Aladdin.

427
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:28,986
Nice to have you on the show.
Can we call you Al? Or maybe just Din?

428
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,616
How about Laddie? Sounds like
''Here, boy.'' Come on, Laddie.

429
00:34:33,747 --> 00:34:36,181
l must've hit my head harder
than l thought.

430
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:38,337
Do you smoke? Mind if l do?

431
00:34:39,187 --> 00:34:42,065
Sorry, Cheetah,
l hope l didn't singe the fur.

432
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:46,459
<i>Rugman, haven't seen you
in a few millennia. Give me some tassel.</i>

433
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:52,139
You're smaller than my last master.
Either that or l'm getting bigger.

434
00:34:52,227 --> 00:34:54,787
Look at me from the side.
Do l look different to you?

435
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:57,461
Wait a minute. l'm your master?

436
00:34:57,547 --> 00:34:59,902
That's right. He can be taught.

437
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:02,945
What would you wish of me?
The ever-impressive,

438
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:05,905
the long-contained,

439
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:10,185
often imitated,
but never duplicated...

440
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:15,021
Genie of the Lamp.

441
00:35:15,107 --> 00:35:16,665
<i>Right here, direct from the lamp.</i>

442
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,261
<i>Right here for
your very much wish-fulfillment.</i>

443
00:35:19,347 --> 00:35:21,463
Thank you.

444
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:24,015
- Wish-fulfillment?
- Three, to be exact.

445
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:26,496
lx-nay on the wishing
for more wishes.

446
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:29,340
That's it. Three.

447
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,577
No substitutions,
exchanges or refunds.

448
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:32,907
- Now l know l'm dreaming.
- You don't realize what you got here.

449
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:36,502
- Now l know l'm dreaming.
- You don't realize what you got here.

450
00:35:36,587 --> 00:35:41,615
So why don't you just ruminate
whilst l illuminate the possibilities?

451
00:35:42,827 --> 00:35:44,977
<i>Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves</i>

452
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:47,183
<i>SCheherazade had a thousand tales</i>

<i>But, master, you're in luCk

459
00:36:02,187 --> 00:36:06,419

00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:55,256
<i>Can your friends pull this</i>

477
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:57,577
<i>Out their little hat?</i>

478
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,056
<i>Can your friends go,,,</i>

479
00:37:00,147 --> 00:37:01,899
<i>Hey, looky here</i>

480
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:05,345
<i>Can your friends go
AbraCadabra, let her rip</i>

481
00:37:05,427 --> 00:37:07,657
<i>And then make the suCker disappear?</i>

482
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:10,215
<i>So don't just sit there
SlaCk-jaWed, buggy-eyed</i>

483
00:37:10,307 --> 00:37:12,423
<i>l'm here to ansWer
All your midnight prayers</i>

484
00:37:12,507 --> 00:37:14,418
<i>You got me bona fide, Certified</i>

485
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:16,862
<i>You got a genie
For a Chargé d'affaires</i>

486
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:19,177
<i>l got a poWerful urge to help you out</i>

487
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:21,303
<i>So What's your Wish?
l really Want to knoW</i>

488
00:37:21,387 --> 00:37:23,537
<i>You got a list that's
Three miles long, no doubt</i>

489
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:26,619
<i>Well, all you got to do is rub like so</i>

490
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:30,586
<i>Mr, Aladdin, sir,
Have a Wish or two or three</i>

491
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,862
<i>l'm on the job, you big nabob</i>

492
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:34,903
<i>You ain't never had a friend</i>

493
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:41,500
<i>You ain't never had a friend</i>

494
00:37:41,587 --> 00:37:44,101
<i>Like me</i>

495
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:52,264
<i>You ain't never had a friend like me</i>

496
00:37:58,107 --> 00:37:59,745
So what'll it be, Master?

497
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:03,422
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes l want, right?

498
00:38:03,507 --> 00:38:04,656
Almost.

499
00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:07,784
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

500
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:08,822
Like?

501
00:38:08,907 --> 00:38:11,341
<i>Rule one. l can't kill anybody.</i>

502
00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:13,338
So don't ask.

503
00:38:13,427 --> 00:38:18,547
<i>Rule two. l can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.</i>

504
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:20,658
<i>You little punim there.</i>

505
00:38:20,747 --> 00:38:24,820
<i>Rule three.
l can't bring people back from the dead.</i>

506
00:38:24,907 --> 00:38:28,183
lt's not a pretty picture.
l don't like doing it.

507
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:30,542
Other than that, you got it.

508
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:38,544
Provisos? You mean limitations?
On wishes?

509
00:38:38,627 --> 00:38:40,140
Some all-powerful genie!

510
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:42,866
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

511
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:46,303
l don't know. He probably can't even
get us out of this cave.

512
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:48,662
Looks like we'll have to find a way out.

513
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:50,544
Excuse me.

514
00:38:50,627 --> 00:38:53,380
Are you looking at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

515
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:56,300
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

516
00:38:56,387 --> 00:38:59,743
And you're walking out on me?
l don't think so.

517
00:38:59,827 --> 00:39:03,502
Not right now.
You're getting your wishes, so sit down.

518
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:07,660
ln case of emergency,
the exits are here.

519
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:10,944
Anywhere. Keep your hands
and arms inside the carpet.

520
00:39:11,027 --> 00:39:12,938
We're...

521
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:15,623
out of here.

522
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:19,542
Jafar, this is an outrage.

523
00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:22,585
lf it weren't for all your years
of loyal service...

524
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:26,865
From now on, you're to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me.

525
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,336
Before they are beheaded.

526
00:39:29,427 --> 00:39:32,225
l assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

527
00:39:32,307 --> 00:39:38,223
Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put
this whole messy business behind us.

528
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:39,456
Please.

529
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:43,904
My most abject and humblest
apologies to you as well, Princess.

530
00:39:43,987 --> 00:39:46,820
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

531
00:39:46,907 --> 00:39:50,946
When l am queen,
l will have the power to get rid of you.

532
00:39:52,587 --> 00:39:54,862
That's nice. All settled, then.

533
00:39:54,947 --> 00:39:58,257
Now, Jasmine,
getting back to this suitor business...

534
00:39:58,347 --> 00:40:00,417
Jasmine!

535
00:40:02,707 --> 00:40:05,983
lf only l had gotten that lamp.

536
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:09,742
''l will have the power
to get rid of you.''

537
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:15,697
To think we gotta keep kissing up
to that chump and his chump daughter

538
00:40:15,787 --> 00:40:17,823
for the rest of our lives.

539
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:22,185
No, lago. Only until she finds
a chump husband.

540
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:24,781
Then she'll have us banished.

541
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:26,858
Or beheaded.

542
00:40:29,547 --> 00:40:31,185
Wait a minute.

543
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:34,304
What if you were the chump husband?

544
00:40:34,387 --> 00:40:35,866
What?

545
00:40:35,947 --> 00:40:38,620
You marry the princess, right?

546
00:40:38,707 --> 00:40:42,461
And then you become the sultan.

547
00:40:44,147 --> 00:40:46,297
Marry the shrew.

548
00:40:46,387 --> 00:40:48,343
l become the sultan.

549
00:40:48,427 --> 00:40:50,418
The idea has merit.

550
00:40:50,507 --> 00:40:51,940
Yes, merit.

551
00:40:52,027 --> 00:40:58,182
And then we drop poppa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

552
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:06,977
l love the way
your foul little mind works.

553
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:19,266
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

554
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:22,942
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

555
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:26,099
Thank you. Goodbye, now.
Goodbye, thank you.

556
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:30,066
Well, how about that,
Mr. Doubting Mustafa?

557
00:41:30,147 --> 00:41:32,138
You sure showed me.

558
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:34,818
Now about my three wishes...

559
00:41:34,907 --> 00:41:36,818
Dost mine ears deceive me?

560
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:40,263
Three? You are down by one, boy.

561
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:43,657
No, l never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

562
00:41:43,747 --> 00:41:45,738
You did that on your own.

563
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,543
l feel sheepish.

564
00:41:49,627 --> 00:41:52,744
All right, you bad boy.
But no more freebies.

565
00:41:52,827 --> 00:41:54,465
Fair deal.

566
00:41:54,547 --> 00:41:57,903
Three wishes.
l want them to be good.

567
00:41:57,987 --> 00:41:59,705
What would you wish for?

568
00:41:59,787 --> 00:42:01,743
Me?

569
00:42:01,827 --> 00:42:03,818
No one's asked me that before.

570
00:42:03,907 --> 00:42:05,738
Well, in my case...

571
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:07,499
- Forget it.
- What?

572
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:09,578
- l can't tell you.
- Come on.

573
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:12,903
Freedom.

574
00:42:12,987 --> 00:42:16,218
- You're a prisoner?
- lt's part of the whole genie gig.

575
00:42:16,307 --> 00:42:19,140
Phenomenal cosmic powers.

576
00:42:20,187 --> 00:42:23,497
- ltty-bitty living space.
- Genie, that's terrible.

577
00:42:23,587 --> 00:42:26,465
But oh, to be free.

578
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:28,742
Not to have to go, ''What do you need?''

579
00:42:28,827 --> 00:42:30,818
''What do you need?''
''What do you need?''

580
00:42:30,907 --> 00:42:32,704
To be my own master.

581
00:42:32,787 --> 00:42:38,737
Such a thing would be greater than all
the magic and treasures in the world.

582
00:42:38,827 --> 00:42:42,456
But what am l talking about?
lt's not going to happen.

583
00:42:42,547 --> 00:42:46,176
- Wake up and smell the hummus.
- Why not?

584
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:49,942
The only way l get out of this
is if my master wishes me out.

585
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:52,495
So you can guess
how often that's happened.

586
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:54,418
l'll do it. l'll set you free.

587
00:42:54,507 --> 00:42:56,543
Yeah, right.

588
00:42:57,067 --> 00:43:01,982
l promise. After my first two wishes,
l'll use my third wish to set you free.

589
00:43:03,107 --> 00:43:05,382
Well, here's hoping.

590
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:07,742
Let's make some magic.

591
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:10,387
So how about it?
What is it you want most?

592
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:14,096
Well, there's this girl.

593
00:43:14,187 --> 00:43:17,975
Wrong. l can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

594
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:22,345
But, Genie, she's smart and fun and...

595
00:43:22,427 --> 00:43:24,304
- Pretty?
- Beautiful.

596
00:43:24,387 --> 00:43:27,424
She's got these eyes that just...
and this hair.

597
00:43:27,507 --> 00:43:29,941
And her smile...

598
00:43:33,587 --> 00:43:37,705
But she's the princess.
To even have a chance, l'd have to be...

599
00:43:39,027 --> 00:43:41,780
- Can you make me a prince?
- Let's see.

600
00:43:41,867 --> 00:43:43,858
<i>Chicken à la King.</i>

601
00:43:43,947 --> 00:43:46,461
No. Alaskan king crab.

602
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:48,777
l hate it when they do that.
Caesar salad.

603
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:51,256
<i>Et tu, Brute? No.</i>

604
00:43:51,347 --> 00:43:53,622
''To make a prince.''

605
00:43:53,707 --> 00:43:55,743
ls that official?
Say the magic words.

606
00:43:55,827 --> 00:43:58,625
Genie, l wish for you
to make me a prince.

607
00:43:58,707 --> 00:44:00,538
All right!

608
00:44:01,387 --> 00:44:05,141
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third-century.

609
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,502
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

610
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:09,543
No. Work with me here.

611
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:12,585
l like it.

612
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:15,659
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

613
00:44:15,747 --> 00:44:18,386
lt says, ''Mode of transportation.''

614
00:44:18,467 --> 00:44:21,425
Excuse me. Monkey boy.
Over here.

615
00:44:22,387 --> 00:44:26,221
Here he comes. And what better way
to make your grand entrance

616
00:44:26,307 --> 00:44:29,902
than riding your very own
brand-new camel?

617
00:44:29,987 --> 00:44:31,898
Watch out. They spit.

618
00:44:31,987 --> 00:44:34,217
Not enough.

619
00:44:34,307 --> 00:44:36,582
Still not enough.
What do you need?

620
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:42,457
Yes. Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.

621
00:44:45,187 --> 00:44:48,179
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.

622
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:56,185
Abu, you look good.

623
00:44:56,267 --> 00:45:00,545
He's got the outfit, he's got
the elephant, but we're not through yet.

624
00:45:00,627 --> 00:45:05,098
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're going to make you a star.

625
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:09,864
Now, let's see.

626
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:17,099
Sire, l have found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

627
00:45:17,187 --> 00:45:20,224
The problem with your daughter.

628
00:45:20,307 --> 00:45:22,423
<i>- Really?
- Right here.</i>

629
00:45:22,507 --> 00:45:26,625
lf the princess has not chosen a husband
by the appointed time,

630
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:29,585
then the sultan shall choose for her.

631
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:34,695
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.
How could l choose someone she hates?

632
00:45:34,787 --> 00:45:37,142
Not to worry, my liege.
There is more.

633
00:45:38,187 --> 00:45:42,465
lf in the event a suitable prince
cannot be found,

634
00:45:42,547 --> 00:45:45,539
a princess must then be wed to...

635
00:45:48,227 --> 00:45:51,060
- lnteresting.
- What? Who?

636
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:53,138
The royal vizier.

637
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:55,104
That would be...

638
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:56,142
...me.

639
00:45:56,227 --> 00:46:02,462
But l thought only a prince
can marry a princess. l'm quite sure.

640
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:06,460
Desperate times call
for desperate measures, my lord.

641
00:46:07,587 --> 00:46:09,657
Desperate measures.

642
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:11,147
You will order the princess
to marry me.

643
00:46:11,147 --> 00:46:13,707
You will order the princess
to marry me.

644
00:46:13,787 --> 00:46:18,144
l will order the princess to...

645
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:20,943
But you're so old.

646
00:46:21,027 --> 00:46:24,576
The princess will marry me.

647
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:27,427
The princess will marry...

648
00:46:27,427 --> 00:46:30,339
What is that? That music?

649
00:46:34,387 --> 00:46:36,378
Jafar, you must come and see this.

650

Splendid. Absolutely marvelous.

696
00:49:13,507 --> 00:49:17,944
Your Majesty, l have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

697
00:49:18,027 --> 00:49:22,896
Prince Ali Ababwa. Of course.
l'm delighted to meet you.

698
00:49:22,987 --> 00:49:26,866
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted too.

699
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:28,505
Ecstatic.

700
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:31,579
- l'm afraid, Prince Abubu...
- Ababwa.

701
00:49:31,667 --> 00:49:35,740
Whatever. You cannot just parade
in here uninvited and expect to...

702
00:49:35,827 --> 00:49:39,263
By Allah, this is quite
a remarkable device.

703
00:49:40,747 --> 00:49:44,342
l don't suppose l might...

704
00:49:44,427 --> 00:49:47,419
Why certainly, Your Majesty. Allow me.

705
00:49:48,307 --> 00:49:50,980
Sire. l must advise against this.

706
00:49:51,067 --> 00:49:54,059
Oh, button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

707
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:06,943
Just where did you say you were from?

708
00:50:07,987 --> 00:50:11,263
Much farther than
you've traveled, l'm sure.

709
00:50:11,347 --> 00:50:13,417
- Try me.
- Duck, Polly.

710
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:19,145
Watch it, you dumb rug.

711
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:27,945
Have a cracker.

712
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:32,497
Out the way, l'm coming in to land.
Jafar, watch this.

713
00:50:32,587 --> 00:50:35,863
- Spectacular, Your Highness.
- lt was lovely.

714
00:50:35,947 --> 00:50:39,860
Yes, l do seem to have a knack for it.

715
00:50:39,947 --> 00:50:44,259
This is a very impressive youth.
And a prince besides.

716
00:50:44,347 --> 00:50:47,737
lf we're lucky, you won't have
to marry Jasmine after all.

717
00:50:47,827 --> 00:50:50,057
- l don't trust him, sire.
- Nonsense.

718
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:54,857
One thing l pride myself on.
l'm an excellent judge of character.

719
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:57,905
Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure.
Not.

720
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:00,983
Jasmine will like this one.

721
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:03,501
And l'm sure l'll like Princess Jasmine.

722
00:51:03,587 --> 00:51:07,216
Your Highness, no.
l must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

723
00:51:07,307 --> 00:51:09,343
This boy is no different
from the others.

724
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:12,066
What makes him think he is worthy?

725
00:51:12,147 --> 00:51:15,264
Your Majesty, l am Prince Ali Ababwa.

726
00:51:15,347 --> 00:51:18,100
Just let her meet me.
l will win your daughter.

727
00:51:18,187 --> 00:51:20,940
How dare you? All of you.

728
00:51:21,027 --> 00:51:26,863
Standing around deciding my future?
l am not a prize to be won.

729
00:51:26,947 --> 00:51:29,415
Oh, dear.

730
00:51:29,507 --> 00:51:33,819
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

731
00:51:33,907 --> 00:51:38,981
l think it's time
to say goodbye to Prince Abubu.

732
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:46,621
What am l going to do?
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.

733
00:51:46,707 --> 00:51:50,541
l should have known l couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.

734
00:51:53,267 --> 00:51:55,303
So move.

735
00:51:58,987 --> 00:52:02,866
That's a good move.
l can't believe it. l'm losing to a rug.

736
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:07,546
- Genie, l need help.
- All right, sparky, here's the deal.

737
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:11,859
lf you want to court the lady, you got
to be a straight shooter. Do ya got it?

738
00:52:11,947 --> 00:52:12,902
What?

739
00:52:12,987 --> 00:52:15,740
Tell her the truth.

740
00:52:15,827 --> 00:52:22,300
No way. lf Jasmine found out l was some
crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me.

741
00:52:22,387 --> 00:52:25,936
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

742
00:52:26,027 --> 00:52:30,225
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

743
00:52:30,307 --> 00:52:32,502
That's the last thing l want to be.

744
00:52:32,587 --> 00:52:34,543
Ok, l'm going to go see her.

745
00:52:34,627 --> 00:52:39,576
l got to be smooth, cool, confident.

746
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:41,658
How do l look?

747
00:52:42,347 --> 00:52:44,736
Like a prince.

748
00:52:56,947 --> 00:53:00,178
Princess Jasmine?

749
00:53:00,267 --> 00:53:02,940
- Who's there?
- lt's me, Prince Ali.

750
00:53:04,067 --> 00:53:06,422
Prince Ali Ababwa.

751
00:53:06,507 --> 00:53:10,785
- l do not want to see you.
- Please, Princess. Give me a chance.

752
00:53:10,867 --> 00:53:13,097
- Leave me alone.
- Down, kitty.

753
00:53:13,187 --> 00:53:15,417
So how's our little beau doing?

754
00:53:16,787 --> 00:53:19,255
Good kitty. Take off.

755
00:53:19,347 --> 00:53:21,815
- Down, kitty.
- Wait.

756
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,943
Do l know you?

757
00:53:24,747 --> 00:53:26,624
No.

758
00:53:26,707 --> 00:53:30,825
You remind me of someone
l met in the marketplace.

759
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:33,296
The marketplace?

760
00:53:33,387 --> 00:53:36,140
l have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

761
00:53:36,227 --> 00:53:40,345
Why, l even have servants who
go to the marketplace for my servants.

762
00:53:40,427 --> 00:53:42,418
So it couldn't have been me you met.

763
00:53:42,507 --> 00:53:44,498
No.

764
00:53:44,587 --> 00:53:48,580
- l guess not.
- Enough about you. Talk about her.

765
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:51,261
She's smart, fun. The hair, the eyes.

766
00:53:51,347 --> 00:53:52,860
Anything. Pick a feature.

767
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:55,658
Princess Jasmine, you're very...

768
00:53:55,747 --> 00:53:58,136
Wonderful. Magnificent. Punctual.

769
00:53:58,227 --> 00:54:00,138
- Punctual.
- Sorry.

770
00:54:00,227 --> 00:54:02,502
- Beautiful.
- Nice recovery.

771
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:06,864
- l'm rich too, you know.
- Yeah.

772
00:54:06,947 --> 00:54:10,576
- The daughter of a sultan.
- l know.

773
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:14,376
A fine prize for any prince to marry.

774
00:54:14,467 --> 00:54:17,061
<i>Right. A prince like me.</i>

775
00:54:17,147 --> 00:54:20,981
<i>- Warning.
- Right. A prince like you.</i>

776
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:24,776
And every other stuffed-shirt,
swaggering peacock l've met.

777
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:26,698
Mayday.

778
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:30,106
Just go jump off a balcony.

779
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:34,057
- Stop her. Want me to sting her?
- Buzz off.

780
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:38,026
OK, fine. But remember, bee yourself.

781
00:54:38,107 --> 00:54:39,825
- Yeah, right.
- What?

782
00:54:41,067 --> 00:54:43,376
You're right.

783
00:54:44,107 --> 00:54:47,099
You aren't just some prize to be won.

784
00:54:47,187 --> 00:54:49,906
You should be free
to make your own choice.

785
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:51,215
l'll go.

786
00:54:51,307 --> 00:54:53,059
- No.
- What?

787
00:54:53,147 --> 00:54:54,341
How...

788
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:57,783
- How are you doing that?
- lt's a magic carpet.

789
00:54:57,867 --> 00:55:00,335
lt's lovely.

790
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,304
You...

791
00:55:02,387 --> 00:55:05,060
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?

792
00:55:05,147 --> 00:55:07,900
We could get out of the palace.
See the world.

793
00:55:07,987 --> 00:55:10,945
- ls it safe?
- Sure. Do you trust me?

794
00:55:11,987 --> 00:55:14,706
- What?
- Do you trust me?

795
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:33,067
Yes.

00:57:51,227 --> 00:57:53,866
- lt's all so magical.
- Yeah.

831
00:57:56,107 --> 00:57:58,667
lt's a shame Abu had to miss this.

832
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:02,865
He hates fireworks.
He doesn't really like flying either.

833
00:58:03,787 --> 00:58:05,743
That is...

834
00:58:05,827 --> 00:58:08,102
- Oh, no.
- You are the boy from the market.

835
00:58:08,187 --> 00:58:10,826
- l knew it! Why did you lie to me?
- l'm sorry.

836
00:58:10,907 --> 00:58:14,217
Did you think l was stupid?
That l wouldn't figure it out?

837
00:58:14,307 --> 00:58:17,140
No, l mean... l hoped you wouldn't.

838
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:20,776
- That's not what l meant.
- Who are you? Tell me the truth.

839
00:58:20,867 --> 00:58:22,619
The truth?

840
00:58:24,307 --> 00:58:26,059
The truth...

841
00:58:27,787 --> 00:58:31,985
The truth is, l sometimes
dress as a commoner.

842
00:58:32,067 --> 00:58:34,627
To escape the pressures of palace life.

843
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:39,105
But l really am a prince.

844
00:58:39,187 --> 00:58:41,621
Why didn't you just tell me?

845
00:58:41,707 --> 00:58:44,096
Well, you know.

846
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,860
<i>Royalty going out
into the city in disguise.</i>

847
00:58:46,947 --> 00:58:49,586
Sounds a little strange,
don't you think?

848
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:53,098
Not that strange.

849
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:17,146
Good night, my handsome prince.

850
00:59:17,227 --> 00:59:18,899
Sleep well, Princess.

851
00:59:41,747 --> 00:59:43,624
Yes!

852
00:59:47,947 --> 00:59:52,020
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.

853
00:59:58,147 --> 00:59:59,899
Hold him.

854
01:00:04,027 --> 01:00:07,099
l'm afraid you've worn out your welcome,
Prince Abubu.

855
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:10,816
- Why you dirty, rotten...
- Make sure he's never found.

856
01:00:52,467 --> 01:00:56,221
Never fails. Get in the bath and
there's a rub at the lamp. Hello?

857
01:00:56,307 --> 01:00:58,025
Al?

858
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:01,745
Kid, snap out of it.

859
01:01:01,827 --> 01:01:04,295
l can't help you unless you make a wish.

860
01:01:04,387 --> 01:01:07,538
You have to say,
''Genie, l want you to save my life.'' OK?

861
01:01:07,627 --> 01:01:09,663
Come on, Aladdin.

862
01:01:10,627 --> 01:01:12,618
l'll take that as a yes.

863
01:01:13,427 --> 01:01:15,418
Up scope.

864
01:01:24,387 --> 01:01:26,662
Don't you scare me like that.

865
01:01:26,747 --> 01:01:29,215
Genie, l...

866
01:01:32,747 --> 01:01:34,942
- Thanks, Genie.
- Oh, Al.

867
01:01:35,027 --> 01:01:37,461
l'm getting kind of fond of you, kid.

868
01:01:37,547 --> 01:01:39,902
Not that l want to pick out curtains.

869
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:51,182
Oh, Father.
l just had the most wonderful time.

870
01:01:51,267 --> 01:01:54,782
- l'm so happy.
- You should be, Jasmine.

871
01:01:54,867 --> 01:01:57,904
l have chosen a husband for you.

872
01:01:57,987 --> 01:02:01,059
- What?
- You will wed Jafar.

873
01:02:02,187 --> 01:02:05,463
You're speechless, l see.
A fine quality in a wife.

874
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:07,378
l will never marry you.

875
01:02:07,467 --> 01:02:10,743
- Father, l choose Prince Ali.
- Prince Ali left.

876
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:13,216
Better check your crystal ball again.

877
01:02:13,307 --> 01:02:16,060
- Prince Ali.
- How in the...

878
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:21,137
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

879
01:02:21,227 --> 01:02:24,139
What ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness.

880
01:02:24,227 --> 01:02:26,377
He's obviously lying.

881
01:02:26,467 --> 01:02:28,822
Obviously lying.

882
01:02:28,907 --> 01:02:32,104
- Father, what's wrong with you?
- l know what's wrong.

883
01:02:34,147 --> 01:02:35,739
- Oh, my.
- Your Highness.

884
01:02:35,827 --> 01:02:38,216
Jafar's been controlling you with this.

885
01:02:38,307 --> 01:02:41,026
What? Jafar?

886
01:02:41,107 --> 01:02:43,143
You low traitor.

887
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:46,537
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.

888
01:02:46,627 --> 01:02:49,016
- Guards.
- Well, that's it. We're dead.

889
01:02:49,107 --> 01:02:51,177
Just dig a grave for both of us.

890
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,418
Arrest Jafar at once.

891
01:02:54,507 --> 01:02:56,941
This is not done yet, boy.

892
01:03:00,587 --> 01:03:03,863
Find him. Search everywhere.

893
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,256
- Jasmine, are you all right?
- Yes.

894
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:10,898
Jafar, my most trusted counselor,
plotting against me all this time.

895
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:14,946
This is horrible, just horrible.
How will l ever...

896
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:22,661
Can this be true?
My daughter has finally chosen a suitor?

897
01:03:23,947 --> 01:03:26,063
Praise Allah.

898
01:03:27,107 --> 01:03:29,496
You brilliant boy.
l could kiss you.

899
01:03:29,587 --> 01:03:32,055
l won't. l'll leave that to my...

900
01:03:32,147 --> 01:03:35,025
But you two will be wed at once.

901
01:03:35,107 --> 01:03:37,541
Yes, and you'll be happy and prosperous.

902
01:03:37,627 --> 01:03:40,937
And then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

903
01:03:41,027 --> 01:03:44,019
- Sultan?
- Yes. A fine youth such as yourself.

904
01:03:44,107 --> 01:03:47,543
A person of your
unimpeachable moral character

905
01:03:47,627 --> 01:03:50,187
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

906
01:03:50,267 --> 01:03:53,259
We got to get out of here.
l got to start packing.

907
01:03:53,347 --> 01:03:56,896
Only essentials. We gotta travel light.
Bring the guns, the knives...

908
01:03:56,987 --> 01:03:59,023
And how about this picture?
l don't know.

909
01:03:59,107 --> 01:04:01,143
l think l'm making a weird face.

910
01:04:03,467 --> 01:04:05,025
Oh, boy.

911
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,302
He's cracked. He's gone nuts.

912
01:04:09,467 --> 01:04:11,264
Get a grip.

913
01:04:11,987 --> 01:04:13,102
Good grip.

914
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:16,577
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that urchin Aladdin.

915
01:04:16,667 --> 01:04:18,498
He has the lamp, lago.

916
01:04:18,587 --> 01:04:22,216
- Why, that miserable...
- But you will relieve him of it.

917
01:04:22,307 --> 01:04:23,501
Me?

918
01:04:27,107 --> 01:04:29,063
Sultan?

919
01:04:29,147 --> 01:04:31,138
They want me to be sultan?

920
01:04:33,267 --> 01:04:35,906
<i>Hail the Conquering hero</i>

921
01:04:43,307 --> 01:04:46,105
You've just won
the heart of the princess.

922
01:04:46,187 --> 01:04:48,178
What are you going to do next?

923
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:58,823
Your line is,
''l'm going to free the genie.''

924
01:04:58,907 --> 01:05:01,137
- Any time.
- Genie...

925
01:05:01,227 --> 01:05:03,058
- l can't.
- Sure you can.

926
01:05:03,147 --> 01:05:06,537
You just go, ''Genie, l wish you free.''

927
01:05:06,627 --> 01:05:08,060
l'm serious.

928
01:05:08,147 --> 01:05:10,217
Look, l'm sorry, l really am.

929
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:14,619
But they want to make me sultan.
No, they want to make Prince Ali sultan.

930
01:05:14,707 --> 01:05:17,460
Without you, l'm just Aladdin.

931
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:19,458
- Al, you won.
- Because of you.

932
01:05:19,547 --> 01:05:23,017
People only think l'm worth anything
because of you.

933
01:05:23,107 --> 01:05:27,066
What if they find out l'm not a prince?
What if Jasmine finds out?

934
01:05:27,147 --> 01:05:29,741
l'd lose her.

935
01:05:29,827 --> 01:05:32,102
l can't keep this up on my own.

936
01:05:32,187 --> 01:05:34,826
l can't wish you free.

937
01:05:35,907 --> 01:05:39,377
l understand.
After all, you've lied to everyone else.

938
01:05:39,467 --> 01:05:41,344
l was beginning to feel left out.

939
01:05:41,427 --> 01:05:44,863
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.

940
01:05:48,507 --> 01:05:50,463
Genie, l'm really sorry.

941
01:05:51,587 --> 01:05:55,136
Well, fine. Then just stay in there.

942
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:58,778
What are you guys looking at?

943
01:06:01,867 --> 01:06:03,778
Look, l...

944
01:06:03,867 --> 01:06:05,983
Abu, l'm sorry. l didn't...

945
01:06:06,067 --> 01:06:08,103
Wait. Come on.

946
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,418
What am l doing?

947
01:06:17,147 --> 01:06:19,502
Genie's right.

948
01:06:19,587 --> 01:06:21,782
l got to tell Jasmine the truth.

949
01:06:21,867 --> 01:06:25,064
Ali, will you come here?

950
01:06:26,707 --> 01:06:28,345
Here goes.

951
01:06:28,427 --> 01:06:30,622
Jasmine, where are you?

952
01:06:31,307 --> 01:06:34,299
- Out in the menagerie. Hurry.
- l'm coming.

953
01:06:38,587 --> 01:06:41,420
You got a problem, pinky?

954
01:06:41,507 --> 01:06:42,656
Jerk.

955
01:06:45,707 --> 01:06:47,982
Jafar's going to be happy to see you.

956
01:06:48,067 --> 01:06:50,865
- Excellent work, lago.
- Ah, go on.

957
01:06:50,947 --> 01:06:54,622
No, really. On a scale of one to ten,
you are an eleven.

958
01:06:54,707 --> 01:06:56,902
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.

959
01:06:56,987 --> 01:06:59,296
l'm embarrassed. l'm blushing.

960
01:06:59,387 --> 01:07:02,379
People of Agrabah,

961
01:07:02,467 --> 01:07:07,177
my daughter
has finally chosen a suitor.

962
01:07:07,267 --> 01:07:09,622
- He is a man of integrity.
- Jasmine?

963
01:07:09,707 --> 01:07:11,584
Ali, where you have you been?

964
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:13,623
There's something l gotta tell you.

965
01:07:13,707 --> 01:07:17,336
The whole kingdom has turned out
for Father's announcement.

966
01:07:17,427 --> 01:07:20,180
Jasmine, listen to me.
Please, you don't understand.

967
01:07:20,267 --> 01:07:23,145
- Good luck.
- Prince Ali Ababwa.

968
01:07:28,027 --> 01:07:32,145
Look at them.
Cheering that little pipsqueak.

969
01:07:32,227 --> 01:07:34,582
Let them cheer.

970
01:07:35,547 --> 01:07:37,822
You know, Al, l'm getting really...

971
01:07:37,907 --> 01:07:39,863
l don't think you're him.

972
01:07:39,947 --> 01:07:44,020
Tonight the part of Al will be played
by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man.

973
01:07:44,107 --> 01:07:46,860
- l am your master now.
- l was afraid of that.

974
01:07:46,947 --> 01:07:49,939
Genie, grant me my first wish.

975
01:07:50,027 --> 01:07:53,576
l wish to rule on high. As sultan.

976
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:00,658
Bless my soul.

977
01:08:01,947 --> 01:08:04,063
What is this? What's going on?

978
01:08:04,147 --> 01:08:09,505
- Oh, my goodness. What's happened?
- Father!

979
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:12,624
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

980
01:08:12,707 --> 01:08:15,540
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

981
01:08:15,627 --> 01:08:17,857
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.

982
01:08:19,107 --> 01:08:23,737
- The lamp.
- Finders keepers, Abubu.

983
01:08:38,467 --> 01:08:40,025
Genie, no!

984
01:08:40,107 --> 01:08:43,065
Sorry, kid. l got a new master now.

985
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:46,655
Jafar, l order you to stop.

986
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:50,581
But there's a new order now. My order.

987
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:53,579
Finally you will bow to me.

988
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:55,498
We will never bow to you.

989
01:08:55,587 --> 01:08:57,578
Why am l not surprised?

990
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,942
lf you won't bow before a sultan,

991
01:09:00,027 --> 01:09:03,178
then you will cower before a sorcerer.

992
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:05,417
Genie, my second wish.

993
01:09:05,507 --> 01:09:09,659
l wish to be the most powerful
sorcerer in the world.

994
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:13,662
Genie, stop.

995
01:09:13,747 --> 01:09:16,215
Ladies and gentlemen,

996
01:09:16,307 --> 01:09:21,062
a warm Agrabah welcome
for sorcerer Jafar.

997
01:09:22,027 --> 01:09:23,858
Now, where were we?

998
01:09:23,947 --> 01:09:27,860
Ah, yes. Abject humiliation.

999
01:09:29,787 --> 01:09:31,743
Down, boy.

1000
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:37,461
Oh, Princess. There's someone
l'm dying to introduce you to.

1001
01:09:37,547 --> 01:09:39,265
Get your hands off her.

1002
01:09:39,347 --> 01:09:43,386
<i>PrinCe Ali, yes it is he
But not as you knoW him</i>

1003
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:48,541
<i>Read my lips
And Come to grips With reality</i>

1004
01:09:48,627 --> 01:09:50,504
<i>Yes, meet a blast from your past</i>

1005
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:53,021
<i>Whose lies Were too good to last</i>

1006
01:09:53,107 --> 01:09:56,417
<i>Say hello to your preCious PrinCe Ali</i>

1007
01:09:56,507 --> 01:09:58,975
Or should we say Aladdin?

1008
01:10:01,187 --> 01:10:03,178
l tried to tell you. l'm just...

1009
01:10:03,267 --> 01:10:07,465
<i>So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin</i>

1010
01:10:07,547 --> 01:10:11,859
<i>Just a Con, need l go on?
Take it from me</i>

1011
01:10:11,947 --> 01:10:16,179
<i>His personality flaWs
Give me adequate Cause</i>

1012
01:10:16,267 --> 01:10:18,098
<i>To send him paCking on a one-Way trip</i>

1013
01:10:18,187 --> 01:10:20,337
<i>So his prospeCts take a terminal dip</i>

1014
01:10:20,427 --> 01:10:22,736
<i>His assets frozen, the venue Chosen</i>

1015
01:10:22,827 --> 01:10:26,103
<i>ls the ends of the earth, Whoopee!</i>

1016
01:10:26,187 --> 01:10:28,747
<i>- So long
- Goodbye. See ya.</i>

1017
01:10:28,827 --> 01:10:33,776
<i>Ex-PrinCe Ali</i>

1018
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:08,457
This is all my fault.

1019
01:11:08,547 --> 01:11:11,619
l should have freed the genie
when l had the chance.

1020
01:11:13,067 --> 01:11:15,103
Are you OK?

1021
01:11:15,867 --> 01:11:17,903
l'm sorry, Abu.

1022
01:11:17,987 --> 01:11:21,741
l made a mess of everything. Somehow.

1023
01:11:21,827 --> 01:11:23,943
Got to go back and set things right.

1024
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:33,378
Carpet.

1025
01:11:37,147 --> 01:11:38,819
Abu, start digging.

1026
01:11:41,347 --> 01:11:43,338
That's it.

1027
01:11:59,587 --> 01:12:01,976
Yeah! All right.

1028
01:12:07,787 --> 01:12:10,301
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.

1029
01:12:12,867 --> 01:12:16,382
Puppet ruler want a cracker?
Here. Here's your cracker.

1030
01:12:16,467 --> 01:12:19,743
Shove 'em down your throat.
Here, have lots of crackers.

1031
01:12:19,827 --> 01:12:25,185
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.

1032
01:12:25,267 --> 01:12:28,862
lt pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.

1033
01:12:31,027 --> 01:12:33,416
A beautiful desert bloom
such as yourself

1034
01:12:33,507 --> 01:12:37,136
should be on the arm
of the most powerful man in the world.

1035
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:39,058
What do you say, my dear?

1036
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:41,741
Why, with you as my queen...

1037
01:12:41,827 --> 01:12:43,306
Never.

1038
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:47,703
l'll teach you some respect.

1039
01:12:49,187 --> 01:12:51,257
No. Genie.

1040
01:12:52,347 --> 01:12:54,656
l have decided to make my final wish.

1041
01:12:54,747 --> 01:13:00,617
l wish for Princess Jasmine
to fall desperately in love with me.

1042
01:13:06,107 --> 01:13:09,622
Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quos.

1043
01:13:09,707 --> 01:13:11,857
Don't talk back, you big blue lout.

1044
01:13:11,947 --> 01:13:16,862
You will do what l order
you to do, slave.

1045
01:13:20,227 --> 01:13:25,540
l never realized
how incredibly handsome you are.

1046
01:13:28,267 --> 01:13:30,258
That's better.

1047
01:13:30,827 --> 01:13:33,387
Now, pussycat,

1048
01:13:33,467 --> 01:13:36,345
tell me more about myself.

1049
01:13:36,427 --> 01:13:40,579
You're tall, dark.

1050
01:13:41,787 --> 01:13:43,618
Well-dressed.

1051
01:13:43,707 --> 01:13:45,937
Al. Little buddy.

1052
01:13:46,027 --> 01:13:50,384
l love...

1053
01:13:54,227 --> 01:13:57,424
- What are you going to do?
- l'm a street rat, remember?

1054
01:13:57,507 --> 01:14:02,342
- l'll improvise.
- Cute little gaps between your teeth.

1055
01:14:02,427 --> 01:14:04,258
Go on.

1056
01:14:04,347 --> 01:14:08,943
And your beard is so...

1057
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,063
twisted.

1058
01:14:11,147 --> 01:14:13,820
You've stolen my heart.

1059
01:14:15,147 --> 01:14:18,696
And the street rat?

1060
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,347
What street rat?

1061
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,023
That was...

1062
01:14:36,267 --> 01:14:37,700
You.

1063
01:14:38,387 --> 01:14:42,175
How many times
do l have to kill you, boy?

1064
01:14:45,307 --> 01:14:47,901
Get the lamp.

1065
01:14:47,987 --> 01:14:49,500
No.

1066
01:14:49,587 --> 01:14:52,181
Princess, your time is up.

1067
01:14:58,467 --> 01:15:00,458
Nice shot, Jafar.

1068
01:15:02,027 --> 01:15:04,018
Don't toy with me.

1069
01:15:06,827 --> 01:15:09,864
Things are unraveling fast now, boy.

1070
01:15:12,787 --> 01:15:14,459
Get the point?

1071
01:15:20,227 --> 01:15:22,741
l'm just getting warmed up.

1072
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:28,867
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

1073
01:15:28,867 --> 01:15:31,017
A snake, am l?

1074
01:15:31,107 --> 01:15:36,135
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike l can be.

1075
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:54,543
Stick that sword into that snake.

1076
01:15:54,627 --> 01:15:56,185
You stay out of this.

1077
01:15:56,267 --> 01:15:58,906
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
lf he can't do it...

1078
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:00,181
Great!

1079
01:16:15,107 --> 01:16:17,063
Jasmine, hang on.

1080
01:16:19,267 --> 01:16:22,464
You little fool.

1081
01:16:22,547 --> 01:16:27,701
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.

1082
01:16:27,787 --> 01:16:30,904
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a...

1083
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:34,900
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.

1084
01:16:34,987 --> 01:16:37,547
The genie.

1085
01:16:38,467 --> 01:16:40,742
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.

1086
01:16:40,827 --> 01:16:42,863
- What?
- He gave you your power.

1087
01:16:42,947 --> 01:16:46,906
- He can take it away.
- Al, why are you bringing me into this?

1088
01:16:46,987 --> 01:16:50,616
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second-best.

1089
01:16:51,747 --> 01:16:56,423
You're right.
His power does exceed my own.

1090
01:16:56,507 --> 01:16:58,657
But not for long.

1091
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:01,739
The boy's crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.

1092
01:17:01,827 --> 01:17:06,184
- One too many hits with the snake.
- Slave, l make my third wish.

1093
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:10,385
l wish to be an all-powerful genie.

1094
01:17:14,027 --> 01:17:16,461
All right. Your wish is my command.

1095
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:18,663
Way to go, Al.

1096
01:17:22,867 --> 01:17:24,903
Yes.

1097
01:17:27,747 --> 01:17:30,136
The power.

1098
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:35,622
The absolute power.

1099
01:17:36,827 --> 01:17:39,102
- What have you done?
- Trust me.

1100
01:17:40,107 --> 01:17:45,181
The universe is mine to command.
To control.

1101
01:17:45,267 --> 01:17:48,862
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

1102
01:17:48,947 --> 01:17:51,507
You wanted to be a genie? You got it.

1103
01:17:51,587 --> 01:17:55,057
- What?
- And everything that goes with it.

1104
01:17:55,147 --> 01:17:57,536
No.

1105
01:17:57,627 --> 01:18:01,017
- l'm getting out of here.
- Phenomenal cosmic powers.

1106
01:18:02,907 --> 01:18:05,187
ltty-bitty living space.

1107
01:18:05,187 --> 01:18:08,145
Al, you little genius, you.

1108
01:18:22,387 --> 01:18:24,378
Get your blasted beak out of my face.

1109
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:28,062
- Shut up, you moron.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1110
01:18:28,147 --> 01:18:33,665
Allow me. Ten thousand years in a cave
of wonders ought to chill him out.

1111
01:18:35,107 --> 01:18:36,859
Shut up.

1112
01:18:45,227 --> 01:18:47,946
l'm sorry l lied to you
about being a prince.

1113
01:18:48,027 --> 01:18:50,018
l know why you did.

1114
01:18:51,267 --> 01:18:56,182
Well, l guess this is goodbye.

1115
01:18:56,267 --> 01:18:59,259
That stupid law. This isn't fair.

1116
01:18:59,347 --> 01:19:01,019
l love you.

1117
01:19:02,787 --> 01:19:05,585
Al, no problem.
You still got one wish left.

1118
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:07,976
Say the word and you're a prince again.

1119
01:19:08,067 --> 01:19:09,978
But what about your freedom?

1120
01:19:10,067 --> 01:19:13,025
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.

1121
01:19:13,107 --> 01:19:14,984
This is love.

1122
01:19:15,067 --> 01:19:19,265
Al, you're not going to find another
girl like her in a million years.

1123
01:19:19,347 --> 01:19:21,736
Believe me, l know. l've looked.

1124
01:19:23,107 --> 01:19:25,621
Jasmine, l do love you.

1125
01:19:25,707 --> 01:19:28,824
But l got to stop pretending
to be something l'm not.

1126
01:19:28,907 --> 01:19:30,863
l understand.

1127
01:19:32,907 --> 01:19:37,378
- Genie, l wish for your freedom.
- One prince pedigree coming up.

1128
01:19:37,467 --> 01:19:40,539
- What?
- Genie, you're free.

1129
01:20:00,707 --> 01:20:03,301
l'm free.

1130
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:08,063
Quick, wish for something outrageous.
Say, ''l want the Nile.'' Try that.

1131
01:20:08,707 --> 01:20:10,698
- l wish for the Nile.
- No way.

1132
01:20:12,227 --> 01:20:14,695
Oh, does that feel good!

1133
01:20:14,787 --> 01:20:17,904
l'm free. l'm free at last.

1134
01:20:17,987 --> 01:20:20,820
l'm hitting the road.
l'm off to see the world.

1135
01:20:31,267 --> 01:20:33,622
l'm going to miss you.

1136
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:35,698
Me too, Al.

1137
01:20:36,907 --> 01:20:39,979
No matter what anybody says,

1138
01:20:40,067 --> 01:20:42,262
you'll always be a prince to me.

1139
01:20:43,747 --> 01:20:48,502
That's right. You've certainly proven
your worth as far as l'm concerned.

1140
01:20:48,587 --> 01:20:51,181
lt's that law that's the problem.

1141
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:54,464
- Father?
- Well, am l sultan or am l sultan?

1142
01:20:54,547 --> 01:21:00,622
From this day forth, the princess
shall marry whoever she deems worthy.

1143
01:21:00,707 --> 01:21:03,062
Him. l choose...

1144
01:21:04,307 --> 01:21:07,458
l choose you, Aladdin.

1145
01:21:08,547 --> 01:21:10,538
Call me Al.

1146
01:21:12,227 --> 01:21:15,663
All of you, come over here.
Big group hug.

1147
01:21:16,547 --> 01:21:19,744
Do you mind if l kiss the monkey?
Hairball.

1148
01:21:19,827 --> 01:21:24,776
Well, l can't do any more damage around
this Popsicle stand. l'm out of here.

1149
01:21:24,867 --> 01:21:27,142
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds.

1150
01:21:27,227 --> 01:21:29,900
<i>Hey, Rugman, Ciao, l'm history.</i>

1151
01:21:29,987 --> 01:21:31,659
No, l'm mythology.

1152
01:21:31,747 --> 01:21:34,466
l don't care what l am. l'm free.

1153
01:21:37,387 --> 01:21:39,742
<i>A Whole neW World</i>

1154
01:21:39,827 --> 01:21:42,295
<i>A Whole neW life</i>

1155
01:21:42,387 --> 01:21:46,699
<i>For you and me</i>

1156
01:22:04,107 --> 01:22:06,143
Made you look.
