1
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,577
{\i1}I'll tell you a tale
of the bottomless blue{\i}

2
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:21,580
{\i1}And it's, hey
to the starboard Heave-ho{\i}

3
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:25,167
{\i1}Look out, lad
A mermaid be waiting for you{\i}

4
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:27,962
{\i1}In mysterious
fathoms below{\i}

5
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,506
Isn't this great?
The salty sea air,

6
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:33,509
the wind blowing
in your face.

7
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:39,181
- A perfect day to be at sea.
- Oh, yes, delightful.

8
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:41,976
A fine strong wind
and a following sea.

9
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:45,688
King Triton must be
in a friendly-type mood.

10
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:49,483
- King Triton?
- Why, ruler of the Merpeople, lad.

11
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:52,278
Thought every good sailor
knew about him.

12
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:57,533
Merpeople.
Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense.

13
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:00,244
But it ain't nonsense.
It's the truth.

14
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:05,207
{\i1}I'm tellin' ya'
Down in the depths of the ocean they live' Oh'{\i}

15
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:10,045
- Aah'
{\i1}- In mysterious fathoms below{\i}

16
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,147
His Royal Highness,
King Triton!

17
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:11,166
And presenting the
distinguished court composer...

18
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:15,212
Horatio Felonious Ignacious
Crustaceous Sebastian.

19
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:26,223
I'm really looking forward
to this performance, Sebastian.

20
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,226
Your Majesty.

21
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:33,522
This will be the finest concert
I have ever conducted.

22
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:38,360
Your daughters--
They will be spectacular.

23
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,737
Yes.

24
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:44,158
- And especially my little Ariel.
- Yes, yes.

25
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:48,454
She has the most
beautiful voice. Hmm?

26
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,582
If only she'd show up
for rehearsals once in a while.

27
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,235
{\i1}Ah, we are the daughters
of Triton{\i}

28
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,405
{\i1}Great father who loves us
and named us well{\i}

29
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,659
{\i1}Aquata{\i}

30
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,328
{\i1}Andrina{\i}

31
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,414
{\i1}Arista, Attina{\i}

32
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:35,459
{\i1}Adella, Alana{\i}

33
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,504
{\i1}And then there is the youngest
in her musical debut{\i}

34
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,423
{\i1}Our seventh little sister
We're presenting her to you{\i}

35
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,259
{\i1}To sing a song Sebastian wrote
her voice is like a bell{\i}

36
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:47,638
{\i1}She's our sister Ari--{\i}

37
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,268
Ariel!

38
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:58,774
Ariel, wait for me.

39
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,610
Flounder, hurry up.

40
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:05,614
You know I can't swim that fast.

41
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,742
There it is.

42
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:11,120
Isn't it fantastic?

43
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,789
Yeah, sure.
I-It's great.

44
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,958
Now let's get outta here.

45
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,294
You're not getting
cold fins now, are you?

46
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,297
Who, me? No way.

47
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:24,925
It's just-- It, uh--
It looks damp in there. Yeah.

48
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,803
And I think I may be
coming down with something.

49
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:31,640
Yeah, I got this cough.

50
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:34,226
All right.
I'm going inside.

51
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,520
You can just stay here
and watch for sharks.

52
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,940
Okay. Yeah, you go.
I'll stay and--

53
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,985
What? Sharks? Ariel!

54
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:47,239
Ariel, I can't-- I mean--

55
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,908
Ariel, help!

56
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:52,870
- Oh, Flounder.
- Ariel.

57
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:56,165
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?

58
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,335
- Flounder, don't be such a guppy.
- I'm not a guppy.

59
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:04,006
This is great.

60
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,009
I mean, I really love this.

61
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:11,889
Excitement, adventure, danger
lurking around every corner--

62
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,936
Ariel!

63
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,188
Oh, are you okay?

64
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,523
Yeah, sure.
No problem. I'm okay.

65
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,909
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh!

66
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,579
Have you ever seen anything so
wonderful in your entire life?

67
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:39,375
Wow! Cool!
But, uh, what is it?

68
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:44,588
- I don't know, but I bet Scuttle will.
- What was that?

69
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:48,884
- Did you hear something?
- Mmm? I wonder what this one is.

70
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:52,054
- Ariel?
- Flounder, will you relax?

71
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,390
Nothing is going to happen.

72
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,311
Shark! Shark!
We're gonna die!

73
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,913
Oh, no!

74
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,445
You big bully!

75
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,784
- Flounder, you really are a guppy.
- I am not.

76
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:01,540
{\i1}Hmm-hmm, fourteen hundred
and ninety-two{\i}

77
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,043
{\i1}Dum-de-dum
Do-do-do{\i}

78
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,629
{\i1}Rum-dim-dim
Do-do-dee-do{\i}

79
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:09,214
- Scuttle!
- Whoa!

80
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:13,010
Mermaid off the port bow!

81
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:17,014
Ariel, how you doin', kid?

82
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:20,851
- Whoa, what a swim.
- Scuttle, look what we found.

83
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,812
Yeah, we were in this sunken
ship, and it was really creepy--

84
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,191
Human stuff, huh?
Hey, let me see.

85
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,366
Oh! Oh!
Look at this.

86
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:38,911
Wow. This is special.
This is very, very unusual.

87
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,040
- What? What is it?
- It's a dinglehopper.

88
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:48,420
Humans use these little babies
to straighten their hair out.

89
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:53,300
See? Just a little twirl here
and a yank there and viola--

90
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:57,262
Ya got an aesthetically pleasing
configuration of hair...

91
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,431
that humans go nuts over.

92
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:01,517
A dinglehopper.

93
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,519
- What about that one?
- Ah!

94
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:09,233
This I haven't seen in years.
This is wonderful.

95
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,069
A banded, bulbous...

96
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:14,196
- snarfblatt.
- Oh!

97
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,616
Now, the snarfblatt dates back
to prehistorical times...

98
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:23,205
when humans used to sit around
and stare at each other all day.

99
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,207
Got very boring.

100
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,837
So, they invented this
snarfblatt to make fine music.

101
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,214
Allow me.

102
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,757
Music!

103
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,135
- It's stuck!
- Oh, the concert!

104
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,055
- Oh, my gosh! My father's gonna kill me!
- The concert was today?

105
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,392
- Maybe you could make a little planter
out of it or something. - I'm sorry.

106
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,769
I've gotta go!
Thank you, Scuttle!

107
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,607
Anytime, sweetie. Anytime.

108
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:07,458
Yes, hurry home,
Princess.

109
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:12,963
We wouldn't want to miss
old Daddy's celebration, now, would we?

110
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:17,635
Ha! Celebration, indeed.
Oh, bah!

111
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:22,723
In my day, we had
fantastical feasts...

112
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,268
when I lived in the palace.

113
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,898
And, now, look at me.

114
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,776
Wasted away to
practically nothing.

115
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,905
Banished and exiled
and practically starving...

116
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,993
while he and his flimsy
fish folk celebrate.

117
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,123
Well, I'll give 'em something
to celebrate soon enough.

118
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:50,376
Flotsam! Jetsam!

119
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:55,631
I want you to keep an extra close watch
on this pretty little daughter of his.

120
00:11:55,756 --> 00:12:00,761
She may be the key
to Triton's undoing.

121
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:08,310
I just don't know what we're going
to do with you, young lady.

122
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:10,312
Daddy, I'm sorry.
I just forgot.

123
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:14,400
- As a result of your careless behavior--
- Careless and reckless behavior--

124
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:16,694
The entire celebration
was, uh--

125
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,489
Well, it was ruined! That's all!
Completely destroyed!

126
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:26,328
This concert was to be the pinnacle
of my distinguished career.

127
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,456
Now, thanks to you, I am
the laughing stock of the entire kingdom!

128
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:35,587
But it wasn't her fault--
Uh, oh, first, uh, the shark chased us.

129
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:39,174
Yeah, yeah. And we tried to--
but we couldn't, and he--

130
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,428
And-- And we--
Whoa!

131
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:44,430
And then we were safe.

132
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,933
But then this seagull came, and it was,
"This is this, and that is that". And--

133
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,186
Seagull?
What? Oh.

134
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,898
You went up to the surface
again, didn't you? Didn't you?

135
00:12:55,065 --> 00:13:00,779
- Nothing happened.
- Oh, Ariel, how many times must we go through this?

136
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:05,534
You could have been seen by one of those
barbarians, by-by one of those humans.

137
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,120
- Daddy, they're not barbarians.
- They are dangerous.

138
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,205
Do you think I want to see
my youngest daughter...

139
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,207
snared by some fish-eater's hook?

140
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,793
I'm 16 years old.
I'm not a child anymore.

141
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,546
Don't you take that tone
of voice with me, young lady.

142
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:21,091
As long as you live under my ocean,
you'll obey my rules.

143
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,927
- But if you would just listen--
- Not another word!

144
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,598
And I am never, never to hear
of you going to the surface again!

145
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,892
Is that clear?

146
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:40,736
Hmph! Teenagers.
They think they know everything.

147
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,448
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

148
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:48,494
Do you think
I was too hard on her?

149
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,496
Definitely not.

150
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,959
Why, if Ariel was my daughter,
I'd show her who was boss.

151
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:59,505
None of this flitting to the
surface and other such nonsense.

152
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,424
No, sir. I'd keep her
under tight control.

153
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,302
- You're absolutely right, Sebastian.
- Of course.

154
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,264
- Ariel needs constant supervision.
- Constant.

155
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,933
Someone to watch over her,
to keep her out of trouble.

156
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,353
- All the time.
- And you are just the crab to do it.

157
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,441
How do I get myself
into these situations?

158
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,527
I should be writing symphonies...

159
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,197
not tagging along after
some headstrong teenager.

160
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:32,454
Hmm? What is that girl up to?

161
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:01,984
Huh?

162
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:11,410
Ariel, are you okay?

163
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,705
If only I could
make him understand.

164
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,791
I just don't see things
the way he does.

165
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:22,004
I don't see how a world that
makes such wonderful things...

166
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,006
could be bad.

167
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:28,427
{\i1}Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?{\i}

168
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,805
{\i1}Wouldn't you think
my collection's complete?{\i}

169
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,766
{\i1}Wouldn't you think
I'm the girI{\i}

170
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:38,479
{\i1}The girl who has
everything?{\i}

171
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,815
{\i1}Look at this trove
Treasures untoId{\i}

172
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,194
{\i1}How many wonders
can one cavern hold?{\i}

173
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,905
{\i1}Lookin' around here
you'd think{\i}

174
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,283
{\i1}Sure, she's got
everything{\i}

175
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,662
{\i1}I've got gadgets
and gizmos aplenty{\i}

176
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,707
{\i1}I've got whozits
and whatzits galore{\i}

177
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,544
{\i1}You want thingamabobs?
I got twenty{\i}

178
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,840
{\i1}But who cares?
No big deal{\i}

179
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:11,929
{\i1}I want more{\i}

180
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,393
{\i1}I wanna be
where the people are{\i}

181
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:21,522
{\i1}I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancin'{\i}

182
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,359
{\i1}WaIkin' around on those--
What do ya call 'em?{\i}

183
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,404
{\i1}Oh, feet.{\i}

184
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,408
{\i1}Flippin' your fins
you don't get too far{\i}

185
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,577
{\i1}Legs are required

00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,415
{\i1}Strollin' along down a--

188
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:45,170
{\i1}Up where they walk
Up where they run{\i}

189
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,258
{\i1}Up where they stay
all day in the sun{\i}

190
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:53,095
{\i1}Wanderin' free
Wish I could be{\i}

191
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,265
{\i1}Part of that world{\i}

192
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,435
{\i1}What wouId I give

193
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,438
{\i1}Out of these waters?{\i}

194
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,858
{\i1}What would I pay
to spend a day{\i}

195
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,194
{\i1}Warm on the sand?{\i}

196
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,197
{\i1}Bet ya on land

197
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,827
{\i1}Bet they don't reprimand
their daughters{\i}

198
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,289
{\i1}Bright young women
sick of swimmin'{\i}

199
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:25,669
{\i1}Ready to stand{\i}

200
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,590
{\i1}And ready to know
what the people know{\i}

201
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,218
{\i1}Ask 'em my questions
and get some answers{\i}

202
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,640
{\i1}What's a fire and why does it--
What's the word?{\i}

203
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,725
{\i1}Burn{\i}

204
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,562
{\i1}When's it my turn?
Wouldn't l love{\i}

205
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:49,485
{\i1}Love to explore
that shore up above?{\i}

206
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,365
{\i1}Out of the sea{\i}

207
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,035
{\i1}Wish I could be{\i}

208
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,748
{\i1}Part of that{\i}

209
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:07,586
{\i1}World{\i}

210
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,024
Sebastian!

211
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,741
Ariel, what are you--
How could you-- What is all this?

212
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:41,287
It's, uh--
It's just my collection.

213
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,456
Oh, I see.

214
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:49,336
Your collection, hmm. If your
father knew about this place--

215
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,380
You're not gonna tell him,
are you?

216
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,924
Oh, please, Sebastian,
he would never understand.

217
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:58,053
Ariel, you're under
a lot of pressure down here.

218
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,472
Come with me.
I'll take you home...

219
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,725
and get you something
warm to drink.

220
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,311
- What do you suppose--
- Ariel?

221
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,273
Ariel?

222
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,578
Ariel, what are you--

223
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,247
Jumpin' jellyfish!

224
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:32,087
Ariel? Ariel!
Please! Come back!

225
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,795
Max! Here, boy!

226
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,179
Hey, come on, mutt.
What ya doin', huh, Max?

227
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,182
Come on, Max.

228
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,519
Good boy. Good boy.

229
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,694
Hey there, sweetie!
Quite a show, eh?

230
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,696
Scuttle, be quiet.
They'll hear you.

231
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,573
Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.

232
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,452
We're bein' intrepidaceous.
We're out to discover!

233
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,498
I've never seen a human
this close before.

234
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:54,712
Oh. He's very handsome, isn't he?

235
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,924
I don't know. He looks kind of
hairy and slobbery to me.

236
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,093
Not that one.

237
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,263
The one playing the snarfblatt.

238
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,099
Silence, silence.

239
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:10,060
It is now my honor and privilege...

240
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,438
to present our esteemed
Prince Eric...

241
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,357
with a very special,
very expensive...

242
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,110
very large birthday present.

243
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,697
Ah, Grimsby, ya old beanpole,
you shouldn't have.

244
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,699
I know.

245
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,535
Happy birthday, Eric.

246
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,293
Uh, gee, Grim-- Ha'

247
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,921
It's, uh--
It's-It's really somethin'.

248
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,007
Yes, I commissioned it myself.

249
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,053
Of course, I had hoped
it would be a wedding present.

250
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,555
Come on, Grim. Don't start.

251
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,807
Look, you're not still sore
because I didn't fall for...

252
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,809
the princess of Glowehaven,
are you?

253
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,229
Oh, my! Oh, Eric,
it isn't me alone.

254
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,608
The entire kingdom wants
to see you happily settled down...

255
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,610
with the right girl.

256
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,237
Oh, she's out there somewhere.
I just--

257
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,950
I just haven't found her yet.

258
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,286
Well, perhaps you haven't
been looking hard enough.

259
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,039
Believe me, Grim,
when I find her, I'll know.

260
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,794
Without a doubt, it'll just--
bam-- hit me like lightning.

261
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,301
Hurricane a-comin'!

262
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:29,640
Stand fast!
Secure the riggin'!

263
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:50,995
Whoa! The wind's all ofa sudden
on the move here! Yo!

264
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,331
Ariel!

265
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:31,327
Look out!

266
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,967
Grim! Ha-Hang on!

267
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,348
Max!

268
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:11,867
Jump, Max! Come on, boy!
Jump! You can do it, Max!

269
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,461
Eric!

270
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:06,213
Is he... dead?

271
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,633
It's hard to say.

272
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,348
Oh, I-- I can't
make out a heartbeat.

273
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:21,020
No, look'
He's breathing.

274
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,106
He's so beautiful.

275
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:30,195
{\i1}What would I give
to live where you are{\i}

276
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:34,283
{\i1}What would I pay
to stay here beside you{\i}

277
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:41,332
{\i1}What would I do to see you
smiling at me{\i}

278
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,127
{\i1}Where would we walk
Where would we run{\i}

279
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,839
{\i1}If we could stay all day
in the sun{\i}

280
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:53,177
{\i1}Just you and me
and I could be{\i}

281
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:57,306
{\i1}Part of your world{\i}

282
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:03,312
Eric? Eric!

283
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,691
You really delight in
these sadistic strains...

284
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,569
on my blood pressure, don't you?

285
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,322
A-A girl... rescued me.

286
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:17,368
She-- She was singing.

287
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,330
She had the most
beautiful voice.

288
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:25,501
Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed
a bit too much seawater.

289
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:29,213
Off we go.
Come on, Max.

290
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,216
We just gonna forget
this whole thing ever happened.

291
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,385
The sea king will never know.

292
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:39,223
You won't tell him. I won't tell him.
I will stay in one piece.

293
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:44,353
{\i1}I don't know when
I don't know how{\i}

294
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:50,693
{\i1}But I know something's
starting right now{\i}

295
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:54,029
{\i1}Watch and you'll see{\i}

296
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,366
{\i1}Someday I'll be{\i}

297
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,868
{\i1}Part of your{\i}

298
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:04,748
{\i1}World{\i}

299
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:20,431
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't stand it. It's too easy.

300
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:23,892
The child is in love
with a human.

301
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:27,229
And not just any human.
A prince'

302
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,650
Her daddy will love that.

303
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,903
King Triton's headstrong,
lovesick girl...

304
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:40,326
would make a charming addition
to my little garden.

305
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,590
Ariel, dear, time to come out.

306
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,634
You've been in there
all morning.

307
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,973
What is with her lately?

308
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,272
- Oh. Morning, Daddy.
- Well.

309
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,739
- Oh, she's got it bad.
- What? What has she got?

310
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,618
Isn't it obvious, Daddy?
Ariel's in love.

311
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:26,872
Ariel? In love?

312
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,625
Okay. So far, so good.

313
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,836
I don't think the king knows.

314
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:36,924
But it will not be easy keeping
something like this a secret for long.

315
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:41,178
He loves me.

316
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,306
Mmm. He loves me not.

317
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:48,852
He loves me!
I knew it!

318
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,854
Ariel, stop talking crazy!

319
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,440
I gotta see him again...
tonight.

320
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,402
- Scuttle knows where he lives.
- Ariel, please!

321
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,030
Will you get your head out of the clouds
and back in the water where it belongs?

322
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:04,118
I'll swim up to his castle, then Flounder
will splash around to get his attention.

323
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,912
- And then we'll go--
- Down here is your home!

324
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,206
Ariel, listen to me.

325
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,208
{\i1}The human world--
It's a mess{\i}

326
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:16,213
{\i1}Life under the sea is better
than anything they got up there{\i}

327
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,218
{\i1}The seaweed is always greener
in somebody else's lake{\i}

328
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,554
{\i1}You dream about
going up there{\i}

329
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:26,223
{\i1}But that is a big mistake{\i}

330
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,475
{\i1}Just look at the world
around you{\i}

331
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,936
{\i1}Right here on the ocean floor{\i}

332
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,355
{\i1}Such wonderfuI things

333
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,983
{\i1}What more is you lookin' for{\i}

334
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:40,738
{\i1}Under the sea
Under the sea{\i}

335
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:45,200
{\i1}Darling, it's better
down where it's wetter take it from me{\i}

336
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:49,913
{\i1}Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away{\i}

337
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,417
{\i1}While we devoting full time
to floating under the sea{\i}

338
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,591
{\i1}Down here all the fish is happy{\i}

339
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:03,260
{\i1}As off through the waves
they roll ,yeah{\i}

340
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,262
{\i1}The fish on the land
ain't happy{\i}

341
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,098
{\i1}They sad
'cause they in the bowl{\i}

342
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,726
{\i1}But fish in the bowl is lucky{\i}

343
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,895
{\i1}They in for a worser fate{\i}

344
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,439
{\i1}One day when the boss get hungry{\i}

345
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,441
{\i1}Guess who's gonna
be on the plate{\i}

346
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,069
{\i1}What? No!
Under the sea{\i}

347
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,446
{\i1}Under the sea{\i}

348
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:27,284
{\i1}Nobody beat us, fry us
and eat us in fricassee{\i}

349
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,162
{\i1}We what the land folks
loves to cook{\i}

357
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:54,478

You got to hear it under the sea{\i}

They know where it's at{\i}

{\i1}What do they got
A lot of sand{\i}

371
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,038
{\i1}We got a hot crustacean band{\i}

377
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:15,851
{\i1}Under the sea{\i}

378
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,857
Ariel?

379
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,031
Oh, somebody's got to nail
that girl's fins to the floor.

380
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:32,534
Sebastian!

381
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,872
Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.

382
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,960
- I've got an urgent message from the sea king.
- The sea king?

383
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:44,546
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.

384
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:50,261
- He knows.
- Hey, let's see now.

385
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:54,556
Oh, who could
the lucky merman be?

386
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:03,065
Come in, Sebastian.

387
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,279
I mustn't overreact.
I must remain calm.

388
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,995
Yes?

389
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,623
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Yes, Sebastian.

390
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,334
I'm concerned about Ariel.

391
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,754
Have you noticed
she's been acting peculiar lately?

392
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:30,801
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

393
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:34,597
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

394
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,765
You haven't noticed, hmm?

395
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,643
Oh, well, I--

396
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:44,106
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?

397
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:48,110
I know you've been keeping
something from me.

398
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,447
Keeping something?

399
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,449
About Ariel?

400
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,997
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?

401
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:05,628
I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

402
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:08,797
I told her to stay away
from humans! They are bad!

403
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:13,636
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?

404
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,638
Humans?

405
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,059
Who said anything about humans?

406
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:25,856
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

407
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:30,277
You'll see.
It's a surprise.

408
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,404
Oh, Flounder.

409
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:36,408
Flounder, you're the best!

410
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:41,038
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

411
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:46,168
Why, Eric, run away with you?

412
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:49,922
Oh, this is all so-- so sudden.

413
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,261
Daddy?

414
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,685
I consider myself
a reasonable merman.

415
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:08,524
I set certain rules, and I expect
those rules to be obeyed.

416
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:12,611
- But, Dad, I--
- Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?

417
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:17,366
- Daddy, I had to--
- Contact between the human world and the mer world is strictly forbidden.

418
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,202
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

419
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:23,789
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

420
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,292
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

421
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,295
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

422
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:33,299
Spineless, savage, harpooning
fish-eaters incapable of any feeling--

423
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,467
Daddy, I love him!

424
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,220
No!

425
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,639
Have you lost
your senses completely?

426
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:44,184
- He's a human. You're a mermaid.
- I don't care.

427
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:48,439
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.

428
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:52,401
And if this is the
only way, so be it!

429
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,948
Daddy! No!

430
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,618
No! Please!

431
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:04,413
Daddy, stop!
Daddy, stop it!

432
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,335
Daddy, no!

433
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:34,777
Ariel, I--

434
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,112
Just go away.

435
00:36:55,631 --> 00:37:00,344
- Poor child.
- Poor, sweet child.

436
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:06,141
She has a very serious problem.

437
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:09,520
If only there were
something we could do.

438
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:12,523
But there is something.

439
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:17,236
Who-- Who are you?

440
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:19,655
Don't be scared.

441
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,908
We represent someone
who can help you.

442
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:28,080
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

443
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,165
Just imagine--

444
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,209
You and your prince--

445
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:36,714
Together forever.

446
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,721
- I don't understand.
- Ursula has great powers.

447
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:47,766
The sea witch?

448
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:51,145
Why, that's--
I couldn't possibly.

449
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,231
No! Get out of here.
Leave me alone!

450
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:57,526
Suit yourself.

451
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:00,863
That was only a suggestion.

452
00:38:10,623 --> 00:38:15,044
- Wait.
- Yes?

453
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:19,381
- Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

454
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,884
It was an accident.

455
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:25,054
Ariel?
Where are you going?

456
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:27,848
Ariel, what are you doing
here with this riffraff?

457
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:31,101
I'm going to see Ursula.

458
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,938
Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

459
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:37,608
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

460
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:42,488
But-- But, I--
Come on!

461
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,630
This way.

462
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:21,777
Come in.
Come in, my child.

463
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:27,116
We mustn't lurk in doorways.
It's rude.

464
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:30,119
One might question
your upbringing.

465
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,666
Now, then, you're here...

466
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:40,713
because you have a thing for this human,
this, uh, prince fellow.

467
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:46,385
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

468
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:49,013
Well, angelfish...

469
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:53,976
the solution to
your problem is simple.

470
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:59,690
The only way to get what you want
is to become a human yourself.

471
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:01,317
Can you do that?

472
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:07,823
My dear, sweet child.
That's what I do.

473
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,950
It's what I live for:

474
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:14,288
to help unfortunate merfolk
like yourself...

475
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:19,251
poor souls with
no one else to turn to.

476
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:24,131
{\i1}I admit that in the past
I've been a nasty{\i}

477
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:27,843
{\i1}They weren't kidding when
they called me well, a witch{\i}

478
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:31,263
{\i1}But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways{\i}

479
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,724
{\i1}Repented, seen the light
and made a switch{\i}

480
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:36,101
{\i1}True? Yes.{\i}

481
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:40,022
{\i1}And I fortunately know
a little magic{\i}

482
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:43,192
{\i1}It's a talent that
I aIways have possessed{\i}

483
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,695
{\i1}And here lateIy, please don't laugh,
I use it on behalf{\i}

484
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,782
{\i1}Of the miserable
lonely and depressed{\i}

485
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:52,034
Pathetic.

486
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:55,287
{\i1}Poor unfortunate souls{\i}

487
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,540
{\i1}In pain, in need{\i}

488
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:01,710
{\i1}This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl{\i}

489
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,880
{\i1}And do I help them
Yes, indeed{\i}

490
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:10,844
{\i1}Those poor, unfortunate souls
So sad, so true{\i}

491
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,056
{\i1}They come flocking to my cauldron,
crying Spells, Ursula, please{\i}

492
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:17,559
{\i1}And I help them
Yes, I do{\i}

493
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:19,561
{\i1}Now it's happened
once or twice{\i}

494
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,814
{\i1}Someone couldn't
pay the price{\i}

495
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:26,151
{\i1}And I'm afraid I had to
rake 'em across the coals{\i}

496
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,237
{\i1}Yes, I've had
the odd complaint{\i}

497
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:31,907
{\i1}But on the whole
I've been a saint{\i}

498
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:36,954
{\i1}To those poor
unfortunate souls{\i}

499
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:39,081
Now, here's the deal.

500
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:44,336
I will make you a potion that will
turn you into a human for three days.

501
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:46,964
Got that? Three days.

502
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:49,800
Now, listen,
this is important.

503
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:52,261
Before the sun sets
on the third day...

504
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:56,765
you've got to get dear old princie
to fall in love with you.

505
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,768
That is,
he's got to kiss you.

506
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:05,274
Not just any kiss--
the kiss of true love.

507
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:09,028
If he does kiss you before
the sun sets on the third day...

508
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:13,115
you'll remain human
permanently.

509
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,660
But if he doesn't,
you'll turn back into a mermaid...

510
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:20,789
and... you belong to me!

511
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:23,709
No, Ariel!

512
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:26,170
Have we got a deal?

513
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:31,342
If I become human, I'll never be
with my father or sisters again.

514
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:33,719
That's right.

515
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:37,056
But you'll have your man.

516
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:42,478
Life's full of
tough choices, isn't it?

517
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:48,651
Oh! And there is
one more thing.

518
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,320
We haven't discussed
the subject of payment.

519
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,405
You can't get something
for nothing, you know.

520
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:55,950
- But I don't have any--
- I'm not asking much.

521
00:42:56,075 --> 00:43:00,204
Just a token really, a trifle.
You'll never even miss it.

522
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:04,708
What I want from you
is your voice.

523
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:08,921
- My voice?
- You've got it, sweetcakes.

524
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:12,591
No more talking, singing.
Zip!

525
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:14,677
But without my voice,
how can I--

526
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:18,639
You'll have your looks,
your pretty face.

527
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:24,770
And don't underestimate the importance
of body language! Ha!

528
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:27,731
{\i1}The men up there
don't like a lot of blabber{\i}

529
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:30,359
{\i1}They think a girl
who gossips is a bore{\i}

530
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:33,696
{\i1}Yes, on land it's much preferred
for ladies not to say a word{\i}

531
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:37,074
{\i1}And, after all, dear what is idle prattle for
Come on, then!{\i}

532
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:40,035
{\i1}They're not all that
impressed with conversation{\i}

533
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,705
{\i1}True gentlemen avoid it
when they can{\i}

534
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:45,958
{\i1}But they dote and swoon and fawn
on a lady who's with drawn{\i}

535
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,419
{\i1}It's she who holds her tongue
who gets her man{\i}

536
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:52,381
{\i1}Come on, you poor
unfortunate soul{\i}

537
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:55,384
{\i1}Go ahead
Make your choice{\i}

538
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:58,470
{\i1}I'm a very busy woman
and I haven't got all day{\i}

539
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:01,390
{\i1}It won't cost much
just your voice{\i}

540
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:03,726
{\i1}Ya poor, unfortunate soul{\i}

541
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:06,729
{\i1}It's sad, but true{\i}

542
00:44:06,854 --> 00:44:09,273
{\i1}If you want to cross a bridge
my sweet, you've got to pay the toll{\i}

543
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,610
{\i1}Take a gulp and take a breath
and go ahead and sign the scroll{\i}

544
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,903
{\i1}Flotsam, Jetsam
Now I've got her, boys{\i}

545
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:18,741
{\i1}The boss is on a roll{\i}

546
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:21,910
{\i1}This poor, unfortunate{\i}

547
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:27,458
{\i1}Soul{\i}

548
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,836
{\i1}Beluga, sevruga{\i}

549
00:44:31,003 --> 00:44:35,007
{\i1}Come winds of the Caspian Sea{\i}

550
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:38,719
{\i1}Larynxis, glossitis
Et maxlaryngitis{\i}

551
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:42,306
{\i1}La voce to me{\i}

552
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:44,683
Now, sing!

553
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:53,525
Keep singing!

554
00:45:53,002 --> 00:45:57,923
That voice.
I can't get it out of my head.

555
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:01,969
I've looked everywhere, Max.
Where could she be?

556
00:46:20,988 --> 00:46:25,784
Well, look at what
the catfish dragged in.

557
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:28,495
Look at ya. Look at ya.

558
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:31,874
There's somethin' different.
Don't tell me.

559
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:34,668
I got it.
It's your hairdo, right?

560
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:36,795
You've been usin'
the dinglehopper, right?

561
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:41,884
No? No, huh?
Well, let me see.

562
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:43,886
New seashells?

563
00:46:44,053 --> 00:46:49,058
No new seashells. I gotta admit
I can't put my foot on it right now.

564
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:52,227
- But if I just stand here long enough--
- She's got legs, you idiot!

565
00:46:52,353 --> 00:46:56,649
She traded her voice to the sea witch
and got legs. Geez, man!

566
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:58,233
I knew that.

567
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,402
Ariel's been
turned into a human.

568
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:03,364
She's gotta make the prince fall
in love with her, and he's gotta k--

569
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:06,992
- He's gotta kiss her.
- And she's only got three days!

570
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:11,413
Just look at her!

571
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,542
On legs! On human legs!

572
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:18,754
My nerves are shot!
This is a catastrophe!

573
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:21,966
What would her father say? I'll
tell you what her father'd say.

574
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:25,302
He'd say he's gonna kill himself
a crab! That's what her father'd say!

575
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:28,264
I'm gonna march meself
straight home right now...

576
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,933
and tell him just like I
should have done the minute--

577
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,478
And don't you shake
your head at me, young lady.

578
00:47:34,645 --> 00:47:37,398
Maybe there's still time.
If we could get that witch...

579
00:47:37,523 --> 00:47:39,400
to give you back your voice...

580
00:47:39,525 --> 00:47:42,945
you could go home with all
the normal fish and just be--

581
00:47:43,112 --> 00:47:46,532
Just be--

582
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:51,870
Just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

583
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:57,042
All right, all right.

584
00:47:57,167 --> 00:48:01,130
I'll try to help ya
find that prince.

585
00:48:03,966 --> 00:48:08,178
Boy, what a soft shell
I'm turning out to be.

586
00:48:08,345 --> 00:48:10,889
Now, Ariel, I'm tellin' ya.
If you wanna be a human...

587
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:14,059
the first thing ya gotta do is
dress like one. Now, let me see.

588
00:48:21,734 --> 00:48:26,447
Max? What?
Huh? What?

589
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:28,449
Max!

590
00:48:29,867 --> 00:48:33,996
Ya look great, kid.
Ya look sensational.

591
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:48,385
Max!

592
00:48:49,428 --> 00:48:50,971
Max!

593
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:53,557
Quiet, Max.

594
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:56,143
What's gotten
into you, fella? Oh.

595
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:59,855
Oh, I see.

596
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:03,025
Are you okay, miss?

597
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,402
I'm sorry if this
knuckle head scared you.

598
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:07,696
He's harmless really, uh--

599
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:14,495
You seem very familiar to me.
Have we met?

600
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:21,377
We have met. I knew it. You're the one,
the one I've been looking for.

601
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:24,713
What's your name?

602
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:27,383
W-What's wrong?
What is it?

603
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:33,722
You can't speak? Oh!

604
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:36,433
Oh, then you couldn't be
who I thought.

605
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:44,233
W-What is it?
Y-You're hurt?

606
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,069
No, no. You need help?

607
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:49,697
Whoa, whoa, careful!
Careful, easy.

608
00:49:51,532 --> 00:49:53,951
Gee, you must have really
been through something.

609
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:56,161
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I'll help you.

610
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:58,163
Come on. Come on.
You'll be okay.

611
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:08,841
Washed up from a shipwreck.

612
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:12,011
Oh, the poor thing.

613
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:15,347
We'll have you feeling better
in no time.

614
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:22,229
I'll just-- I'll just
get this washed for you.

615
00:50:26,567 --> 00:50:28,777
Well, you must have at least
heard about this girl.

616
00:50:28,902 --> 00:50:31,822
- No!
- Gertrude says--

617
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:34,325
When has Gertrude ever
gotten anything right?

618
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:36,327
- I mean, really.
- Madam, please--

619
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:39,830
This girl shows up in rags and doesn't
speak. Not my idea of a princess.

620
00:50:39,997 --> 00:50:42,833
If Eric's looking for a girl,
I know a couple of...

621
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,502
highly available ones right here.

622
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:59,808
Oh, Eric, be reasonable.

623
00:50:59,934 --> 00:51:03,646
Nice young ladies just don't
swim around rescuing people...

624
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:07,107
in the middle of the ocean, and then
flitter off into oblivion like some--

625
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:09,735
I'm tellin' ya, Grim.
She was real.

626
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:12,947
I'm gonna find that girl,
and I'm gonna marry her.

627
00:51:13,072 --> 00:51:16,659
Come on, honey.
Don't be shy.

628
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:26,669
Oh, Eric,
isn't she a vision?

629
00:51:26,794 --> 00:51:29,713
Uh, you look wonderful.

630
00:51:30,965 --> 00:51:32,883
Come, come, come.
You must be famished.

631
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,219
Let me help you, my dear.

632
00:51:35,386 --> 00:51:38,889
There-- Oh, there we go. Eh,
that's better. Now, quite comfy, hmm?

633
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:41,016
Ha, ha. Good.
It's, uh--

634
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:45,604
It's, uh, not often that we have
such a lovely dinner guest, eh, Eric?

635
00:51:58,284 --> 00:52:02,663
Uh, do you like it?
It-It is rather a fine one.

636
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:08,210
- Oh, my.
- S-Sorry, Grim.

637
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:12,923
Why, Eric, that's the first time
I've seen you smile in weeks.

638
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,551
Ah, very amusing.

639
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:17,845
Carlotta, my dear,
what's for dinner?

640
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:23,225
Oh, you're gonna love it! Chef's been
fixing his speciality: stuffed crab.

641
00:52:30,566 --> 00:52:34,153
{\i1}Maurice Chevalier{\i}

642
00:52:39,408 --> 00:52:41,243
{\i1}How I love les poissons{\i}

643
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:44,413
{\i1}Love to chop
and to serve little fish{\i}

644
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:48,208
{\i1}First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out their bones{\i}

645
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:58,677
{\i1}With the cleaver
I hack them in two{\i}

646
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:01,764
{\i1}I pull out what's inside
and I serve it up fried{\i}

647
00:53:01,889 --> 00:53:05,100
{\i1}God, I love little fishes
Don't you?{\i}

648
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:08,771
{\i1}Here's something for
tempting the palate{\i}

649
00:53:08,938 --> 00:53:11,106
{\i1}Prepared in
the classic technique{\i}

650
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:14,735
{\i1}First you pound the fish
flat with the mallet{\i}

651
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,280
{\i1}Then you slash through the skin
Give the belly a slice{\i}

652
00:53:18,405 --> 00:53:24,036
{\i1}Then you rub some salt in
'cause that makes it taste nice{\i}

653
00:53:24,203 --> 00:53:28,749
- Oh.
- Zut alors! I have missed one.

654
00:53:28,874 --> 00:53:30,960
{\i1}Sacre bleu
What is this?{\i}

655
00:53:31,085 --> 00:53:35,798
{\i1}How on earth could I miss such
a sweet little succulent crab{\i}

656
00:53:35,965 --> 00:53:39,051
{\i1}Quelle dommage, what a loss
Here we go in the sauce{\i}

657
00:53:39,218 --> 00:53:42,012
{\i1}Now some flour
I think just a dab{\i}

658
00:53:42,179 --> 00:53:45,140
{\i1}Now I'll stuff you with bread
It don't hurt 'cause you're dead{\i}

659
00:53:45,266 --> 00:53:48,519
{\i1}And you're certainIy
lucky you are{\i}

660
00:53:48,686 --> 00:53:51,355
{\i1}'Cause it's gonna be hot
in my big silver pot{\i}

661
00:53:56,443 --> 00:53:58,570
Eh?

662
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,661
What is this? Ow!

663
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:12,251
Yeow!
Oh, ow, ow, oh!

664
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:38,402
I think I'd better go see
what Louie is up to.

665
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:44,491
Come out, you little pipsqueak,
and fight like a man!

666
00:54:44,617 --> 00:54:47,161
- Louie!
- Ow.

667
00:54:47,286 --> 00:54:52,291
- What are you doing?
- Well, I-I-I was just, uh, uh, uh--

668
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:55,044
I'm sorry, madame.

669
00:54:56,754 --> 00:54:59,590
You know, Eric, perhaps
our young guest might enjoy...

670
00:54:59,757 --> 00:55:02,259
seeing some of the sights
of the kingdom.

671
00:55:02,426 --> 00:55:04,261
Something in the way
of a tour.

672
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:07,389
I'm sorry, Grim.
What was that?

673
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:10,517
You can't spend all your time
moping about. You need to get out.

674
00:55:10,643 --> 00:55:13,896
Do something. Have a life.
Get your mind off--

675
00:55:14,021 --> 00:55:18,108
Easy, Grim, easy. It's not
a bad idea, if she's interested.

676
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:20,402
Well, what do ya say?
Would you like to join me...

677
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:22,780
on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?

678
00:55:22,947 --> 00:55:27,993
Wonderful! Now, let's eat before
this crab wanders off my plate.

679
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,505
Come here, boy.

680
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:58,357
This has got to be,
without a doubt...

681
00:55:58,524 --> 00:56:02,945
the single most
humiliating day of my life.

682
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:08,492
I hope that you appreciate what
I go through for you, young lady.

683
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:12,621
Now, we got to make a plan
to get that boy to kiss you.

684
00:56:12,746 --> 00:56:17,751
Tomorrow, when he takes you
for that ride, you gotta look your best.

685
00:56:17,876 --> 00:56:22,381
You gotta bat your eyes,
like this.

686
00:56:22,548 --> 00:56:26,760
You gotta pucker up
your lips, like this.

687
00:56:37,855 --> 00:56:42,484
You are hopeless, child.
You know that?

688
00:56:43,652 --> 00:56:46,697
Completely hopeless.

689
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:57,708
- Any sign of them?
- No, Your Majesty.

690
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,793
We've searched everywhere.

691
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:03,213
We've found no trace of
your daughter or Sebastian.

692
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:07,509
Well, keep looking. Leave no shell
unturned, no coral unexplored.

693
00:57:07,676 --> 00:57:11,764
Let no one in this kingdom sleep
until she's safe at home.

694
00:57:11,931 --> 00:57:13,891
Yes, sire.

695
00:57:15,142 --> 00:57:20,397
Oh, what have I done?
What have I done?

696
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:47,424
- Has he kissed her yet?
- Not yet.

697
00:57:47,591 --> 00:57:48,592
Oh!

698
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:55,182
Oh, Judy!

699
00:58:12,533 --> 00:58:14,785
Yo! Flounder!
Any kissing?

700
00:58:14,952 --> 00:58:17,329
No, not yet.

701
00:58:17,496 --> 00:58:19,832
Hmm. Well, they'd--
they'd better get crackin'!

702
00:58:48,694 --> 00:58:50,988
Move over.
Move your big feathers.

703
00:58:51,155 --> 00:58:55,910
- I can't see a thing.
- Nothing is happening.

704
00:58:56,035 --> 00:59:01,248
Only one day left, and that boy
ain't puckered up once.

705
00:59:01,373 --> 00:59:03,709
Okay, all right,
this calls for...

706
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:07,838
a little vocal
romantic stimulation.

707
00:59:08,005 --> 00:59:09,840
Stand back!

708
00:59:16,388 --> 00:59:20,935
Wow. Somebody should find that poor
animal and put it out of its misery.

709
00:59:26,357 --> 00:59:30,736
Oh! Geez, man.
I'm surrounded by amateurs.

710
00:59:32,905 --> 00:59:36,617
You want something done,
you've got to do it yourself.

711
00:59:36,825 --> 00:59:41,789
First we got to
create the mood.

712
00:59:41,914 --> 00:59:43,791
Percussion.

713
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:48,712
Strings. Winds.

714
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:51,090
Words.

715
00:59:51,257 --> 00:59:54,093
{\i1}There you see her{\i}

716
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:57,388
{\i1}Sitting there across the way{\i}

717
00:59:57,554 --> 01:00:04,061
{\i1}She don't got a lot to say
but there's something about her{\i}

718
01:00:04,228 --> 01:00:07,523
{\i1}And you don't know why
but you're dyin' to try{\i}

719
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,566
{\i1}You wanna kiss the girl{\i}

720
01:00:09,733 --> 01:00:12,319
D-Did you hear something?

721
01:00:12,444 --> 01:00:15,155
{\i1}- Yes
- You want her{\i}

722
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:18,909
{\i1}Look at her
You know you do{\i}

723
01:00:19,076 --> 01:00:20,911
{\i1}Possible
she wants you too{\i}

724
01:00:21,078 --> 01:00:25,249
{\i1}There is one way
to ask her{\i}

725
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:27,376
{\i1}It don't take a word{\i}

726
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:31,714
{\i1}Not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl{\i}

727
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,257
Sing with me now.

728
01:00:33,424 --> 01:00:36,260
{\i1}Sha-la-la-la-la-la
My, oh, my{\i}

729
01:00:36,427 --> 01:00:40,556
{\i1}Look like the boy too shy
He ain't gonna kiss the girl{\i}

730
01:00:40,681 --> 01:00:44,685
{\i1}Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Ain't that sad, Ain't it a shame{\i}

731
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:49,148
{\i1}Too bad
he gonna miss the girl{\i}

732
01:00:49,315 --> 01:00:51,442
You know, I feel really bad
not knowing your name.

733
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:55,487
Maybe I can guess.
Is it, uh, Mildred?

734
01:00:57,031 --> 01:00:59,158
Okay, no.

735
01:00:59,325 --> 01:01:02,286
How about Diana?
Rachel?

736
01:01:02,453 --> 01:01:06,373
- Ariel. Her name is Ariel.
- Ariel?

737
01:01:06,498 --> 01:01:09,752
Ariel? Oh.

738
01:01:09,877 --> 01:01:13,964
That's kind of pretty.
Okay. Ariel.

739
01:01:14,131 --> 01:01:17,676
{\i1}Now's your moment{\i}

740
01:01:17,843 --> 01:01:20,971
{\i1}Floating in a blue lagoon{\i}

741
01:01:21,138 --> 01:01:23,641
{\i1}Boy, you better do it soon{\i}

742
01:01:23,807 --> 01:01:28,020
{\i1}- No time will be better
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah{\i}

743
01:01:28,187 --> 01:01:31,190
{\i1}She don't say a word
And she won't say a word{\i}

744
01:01:31,357 --> 01:01:33,442
{\i1}Until ya kiss the girl{\i}

745
01:01:36,153 --> 01:01:38,822
{\i1}Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't be scared{\i}

746
01:01:38,906 --> 01:01:42,952
{\i1}You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl{\i}

747
01:01:43,077 --> 01:01:45,537
{\i1}Sha-la-la-la-la-la
Don't stop now{\i}

748
01:01:45,704 --> 01:01:49,083
{\i1}Don't try to hide it how

Kiss the girl?{\i}

757
01:02:11,855 --> 01:02:15,818
{\i1}Go on and kiss the girl{\i}

758
01:02:15,943 --> 01:02:20,531
{\i1}- Go on and--
- Kiss the girl{\i}

759
01:02:22,032 --> 01:02:25,536
Whoa!
Hang on, I've got ya.

760
01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:31,834
Nice work, boys.
That was a close one.

761
01:02:31,959 --> 01:02:35,379
Too close.
The little tramp!

762
01:02:35,546 --> 01:02:37,715
Ah, she's better
than I thought.

763
01:02:37,881 --> 01:02:42,845
Well, at this rate, he'll be
kissing her by sunset for sure.

764
01:02:43,012 --> 01:02:47,641
Well, it's time Ursula took
matters into her own tentacles.

765
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:52,313
Triton's daughter will be mine!
And then I'll make him writhe.

766
01:02:52,438 --> 01:02:55,774
I'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook!

767
01:03:16,795 --> 01:03:19,882
Eric?
If I may say...

768
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:24,094
far better than any dream girl
is one of flesh and blood...

769
01:03:24,261 --> 01:03:29,391
one warm and caring
and right before your eyes.

770
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,527
Ariel!

771
01:04:21,694 --> 01:04:24,780
Ariel, wake up! Wake up!
I just heard the news!

772
01:04:24,947 --> 01:04:28,158
Congratulations, kiddo,
we did it!

773
01:04:28,325 --> 01:04:31,829
Ooh. What is this idiot
babbling about?

774
01:04:31,996 --> 01:04:34,665
Right, as if you two
didn't know, huh?

775
01:04:34,748 --> 01:04:36,625
The whole town's buzzin'
about the prince...

776
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:40,129
gettin' himself hitched
this afternoon!

777
01:04:40,254 --> 01:04:42,464
You know,
he's getting married.

778
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:46,635
You silly side-walker.
I just wanted to wish ya luck.

779
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,555
I'll catch ya later.
I wouldn't miss it!

780
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:06,905
Well, now, Eric.

781
01:05:07,072 --> 01:05:09,533
It appears that
I was mistaken.

782
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:14,705
This mystery maiden of yours
does, in fact, exist.

783
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:17,625
A-And she is lovely.

784
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,127
Congratulations, my dear.

785
01:05:20,252 --> 01:05:23,088
We wish to be married
as soon as possible.

786
01:05:23,255 --> 01:05:27,176
Oh, yes, of course, Eric, but,
these things do take time, you know.

787
01:05:27,301 --> 01:05:30,930
This afternoon, Grimsby.
The wedding ship departs at sunset.

788
01:05:31,096 --> 01:05:36,060
Oh. Oh. Very well, Eric,
uh, as you wish.

789
01:06:34,034 --> 01:06:36,120
{\i1}What a lovely little
bride I'll make{\i}

790
01:06:36,287 --> 01:06:39,123
{\i1}My dear
I'll look divine{\i}

791
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:46,130
{\i1}Things are working out
according to my ultimate design{\i}

792
01:06:47,965 --> 01:06:54,471
{\i1}Soon I'll have that little mermaid
And the ocean will be mine{\i}

793
01:06:58,309 --> 01:07:02,521
The sea witch! Oh, no!
She's gonna-- I gotta--

794
01:07:04,064 --> 01:07:05,441
Ariel!

795
01:07:05,566 --> 01:07:08,611
Ariel!

796
01:07:08,736 --> 01:07:11,614
Ariel, I was flying--
I was--

797
01:07:11,739 --> 01:07:16,327
Of course I was flying,
and I-I saw the-- the watch--

798
01:07:16,493 --> 01:07:19,163
The witch was watchin'
the mirror...

799
01:07:19,246 --> 01:07:21,624
and she was singing
with a stolen set of pipes.

800
01:07:21,749 --> 01:07:24,418
Do you hear what
I'm tellin' you?

801
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:29,882
The prince is marrying
the sea witch in disguise!

802
01:07:30,007 --> 01:07:33,135
- Are you sure about this?
- Have I ever been wrong?

803
01:07:33,302 --> 01:07:35,220
I mean,
when it's important?

804
01:07:35,387 --> 01:07:37,806
What are we gonna do?

805
01:07:37,932 --> 01:07:41,602
Before the sun sets
on the third day.

806
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:51,445
Ariel, grab onto that.

807
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:54,823
Flounder, get her to that boat
as fast as your fins can carry you.

808
01:07:54,949 --> 01:07:56,825
I'll try!

809
01:07:56,951 --> 01:07:59,495
I gotta get to the sea king.
He must know about this.

810
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,664
- Wh-What about me? What about me?
- You!

811
01:08:01,789 --> 01:08:05,084
Find a way to
stall that wedding!

812
01:08:05,251 --> 01:08:07,086
Stall the wedding.
W-What am I...?

813
01:08:07,253 --> 01:08:09,922
What...? That's it!

814
01:08:19,431 --> 01:08:23,602
Move it! Let's go!
We got an emergency here.

815
01:08:35,656 --> 01:08:37,533
Dearly beloved--

816
01:08:39,159 --> 01:08:42,955
Don't worry, Ariel.
We-We're gonna make it.

817
01:08:43,122 --> 01:08:44,957
We're--
We're almost there.

818
01:08:45,124 --> 01:08:48,919
Yes, um, do you, Eric,
take Vanessa...

819
01:08:49,086 --> 01:08:52,214
to be your lawfully
wedded wife...

820
01:08:52,339 --> 01:08:54,925
for as long as
you both shall live?

821
01:08:55,092 --> 01:08:57,219
I do.

822
01:08:57,344 --> 01:08:59,221
It being--
And do you--

823
01:09:08,355 --> 01:09:09,565
Oh!

824
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:19,283
Then by the power--

825
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:21,452
Get away from me,
you slimy little--

826
01:09:35,674 --> 01:09:37,051
Oh, why, you little--

827
01:09:47,394 --> 01:09:50,272
Huh? Ahh. Huh?

828
01:09:59,073 --> 01:10:01,325
- Ariel?
- Eric!

829
01:10:02,493 --> 01:10:05,412
You-- You can talk?

830
01:10:05,621 --> 01:10:08,624
- You're the one.
- Eric, get away from her.

831
01:10:08,791 --> 01:10:13,087
- It-It was you all the time.
- Oh, Eric, I-I wanted to tell you.

832
01:10:13,212 --> 01:10:15,005
Eric, no!

833
01:10:16,924 --> 01:10:18,509
You're too late!

834
01:10:20,678 --> 01:10:22,846
You're too late!

835
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:34,400
- So long, lover boy.
- Ariel!

836
01:10:34,566 --> 01:10:36,026
Poor little princess.

837
01:10:36,193 --> 01:10:39,029
It's not you I'm after.
I've a much bigger fish to--

838
01:10:39,196 --> 01:10:42,366
- Ursula, stop!
- Hmph!

839
01:10:42,533 --> 01:10:47,788
Why, King Triton!
How are you?

840
01:10:47,913 --> 01:10:51,375
- Let her go!
- Not a chance, Triton! She's mine now!

841
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:54,628
- We made a deal.
- Daddy, I'm sorry! I-I--

842
01:10:54,753 --> 01:10:58,173
I didn't mean to!
I didn't know!

843
01:11:01,677 --> 01:11:06,348
You see? The contract's legal,
binding and completely unbreakable...

844
01:11:06,473 --> 01:11:08,350
even for you.

845
01:11:08,475 --> 01:11:13,981
Of course, I always was a girl
with an eye for a bargain.

846
01:11:14,106 --> 01:11:19,320
The daughter of the great sea king
is a very precious commodity.

847
01:11:19,445 --> 01:11:23,616
But I might be willing
to make an exchange...

848
01:11:23,782 --> 01:11:27,620
for someone even better.

849
01:11:27,786 --> 01:11:30,956
- Eric, what are you doing?
- Grim, I lost her once.

850
01:11:31,123 --> 01:11:33,208
I'm not gonna lose her again!

851
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:37,880
Now, do we have a deal?

852
01:11:41,634 --> 01:11:43,510
Ha! It's done then!

853
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:48,599
No! Oh, no!

854
01:11:57,232 --> 01:11:59,276
Your Majesty.

855
01:11:59,443 --> 01:12:00,611
Daddy.

856
01:12:00,778 --> 01:12:05,199
- At last... it's mine.
- No.

857
01:12:09,828 --> 01:12:11,664
You!

858
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:15,167
- You monster!
- Don't fool with me, ya little brat!

859
01:12:15,334 --> 01:12:18,170
Contract or no,
I'll blast-- Ow!

860
01:12:18,337 --> 01:12:20,839
- Why, you little fool.
- Eric! Eric, look out!

861
01:12:21,006 --> 01:12:22,841
After him!

862
01:12:29,556 --> 01:12:32,393
Come on!

863
01:12:32,518 --> 01:12:34,395
Ow!

864
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:39,942
Say good-bye
to your sweetheart.

865
01:12:40,067 --> 01:12:41,860
Aah!

866
01:12:44,738 --> 01:12:49,410
Babies! My poor
little poopsies.

867
01:13:00,379 --> 01:13:02,214
Eric, you've gotta
get away from here.

868
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:04,550
No, I won't leave you.

869
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:27,031
You pitiful,
insignificant fools!

870
01:13:27,197 --> 01:13:29,033
Look out!

871
01:13:30,868 --> 01:13:33,704
Now I am the ruler
of all the ocean!

872
01:13:33,871 --> 01:13:37,416
The waves obey
my every whim!

873
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:40,085
Eric!

874
01:13:41,754 --> 01:13:47,343
The sea and all its spoils
bow to my power!

875
01:14:06,153 --> 01:14:08,030
Eric!

876
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:45,734
So much for true love!

877
01:15:43,459 --> 01:15:47,254
She really does love him,
doesn't she, Sebastian?

878
01:15:49,006 --> 01:15:53,469
Well, it's like
I always say, Your Majesty.

879
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:58,265
Children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

880
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:00,267
You always say that?

881
01:16:04,396 --> 01:16:07,483
Then I guess there's
just one problem left.

882
01:16:07,608 --> 01:16:09,693
And what's that,
Your Majesty?

883
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:13,364
How much I'm going
to miss her.

884
01:17:12,965 --> 01:17:14,633
Aha!

885
01:17:25,352 --> 01:17:28,355
Yes! Thank you. Thank you.

886
01:17:38,365 --> 01:17:39,992
I love you, Daddy.

887
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:44,288
{\i1}Now we can waIk
Now we can run{\i}

888
01:17:44,455 --> 01:17:49,793
{\i1}Now we can stay

889
